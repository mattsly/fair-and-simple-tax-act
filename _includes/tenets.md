## Tenets

1. **Radical Simplicity:** The tax code should be clearly explainable and ideally automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, reduces economic deadweight loss, and limits loopholes (raising revenue). Every tax paying American should have a strong understanding of how the tax code works and what the key levers are. With a more broadly understood tax code with a smaller number key levers, we enable more meaningful public debate about our tradeoffs and priorities. By reducing the tax code to a few transparent levers, we shift the power from specialists back to citizens.

2. **Fuel the Climb (Don't Protect the Summit):** The tax code and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security. It should not reward financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.

3. **Fiscal Durability:** The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic changes. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. An adequately durable systems will reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls. We aim to be agnostic about revenues versus costs and prioritize the most effective path to fiscal health while codifying core American values.

## Tenets

1. **Radical Simplicity:** The tax code should be clearly explainable and, where possible, automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, economic deadweight loss, and loopholes, while enabling more meaningful public debate about tradeoffs and priorities through a smaller set of transparent levers.

2. **Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit):** The tax and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security, not financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.

3. **Fiscal Durability:** The system must be fiscally responsible across economic cycles and demographic changes. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and adjustable parameters that do not require reopening the system’s core structure. A durable system reduces reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, and crisis-driven overhauls while prioritizing the most effective path to long-term fiscal health.

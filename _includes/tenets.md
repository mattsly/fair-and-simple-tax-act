## Tenets

1. **Radical Simplicity:** The tax code should be clearly explainable and ideally automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, economic deadweight loss, limits loopholes (raising revenue). With a less obscure tax code with a few key levers, we enable more meaningful public debate about tradeoffs and priorities.

2. **Fuel the Climb (Don't Protect the Summit):** The tax code and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security, not financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.

3. **Fiscal Durability:** The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic change. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. Durable systems reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls. We aim to be agnostic about revenues versus costs and prioritize the most effective path to fiscal health while codifying core American values.

# Fair & Simple Tax Act
## Phase 2: Social Security Modernization
### PR-FAQ

---

### Relationship to the Project Overview

This document is a **child document** of the Fair & Simple Tax Act Project Overview. It applies the shared design tenets described there—radical simplicity, lifetime fairness, and fiscal durability—to the Social Security system specifically.

Tax reform (Phase 1) and Social Security modernization (Phase 2) are presented as separate PR-FAQs to allow focused analysis and debate. Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

### Overview

This document describes **Phase 2** of the Fair & Simple Tax Act: a targeted modernization of Social Security designed to restore long-term solvency, improve fairness across modern careers, and close entitlement-related loopholes while preserving the core contributory structure of the program.

Phase 2 is narrower in scope than Phase 1. Social Security is fundamentally sound and needs modernization and leakage prevention, not wholesale redesign.

Social Security remains broadly supported: Pew found in 2024 that 79% of adults say benefits should not be reduced in any way.¹ The Trustees project the OASI trust fund is depleted in 2033, with about 77% of benefits payable at that point under current law.² The goal of this phase is to preserve and modernize rather than replace. The reforms below keep the contributory structure intact while closing leakage, aligning benefits with lifetime work, and strengthening the minimum benefit. They aim to secure the program for current retirees and for younger workers who need to trust that the system will be there. Done well, these changes make Social Security simpler to administer, harder to game, and more stable over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions



### 1. What problem is this reform trying to solve?

Social Security faces three concrete, well-documented structural problems under current law.

**First, the program is on a clear path to long-term insolvency.**
According to the Social Security Trustees, the combined trust funds are projected to be depleted in the mid-2030s. At that point, incoming payroll taxes would cover only about 75–80% of scheduled benefits, triggering automatic benefit reductions absent legislative action. Over the standard 75-year projection window, the actuarial shortfall is roughly 3.5% of taxable payroll, a gap driven primarily by demographic change and the growing concentration of wages above the payroll tax cap.¹

**Second, a meaningful share of labor income at the top escapes payroll taxation entirely.**
High-income individuals increasingly earn through S-corporations, partnerships, and similar pass-through entities that allow labor income to be legally recharacterized as business profits or investment returns. While lawful, this systematically reduces payroll tax contributions from those with the greatest ability to pay and weakens the contributory integrity of the system. Treasury and IRS analyses suggest this leakage plausibly amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year, large enough to materially worsen long-run solvency even if precise estimates vary.²

**Third, benefit scaling at very high lifetime earnings no longer serves a clear insurance purpose.**
Under current law, individuals with extremely high lifetime earnings continue to receive Social Security benefits that are small relative to their total retirement resources but meaningful in aggregate. While this is not a dominant cost driver, it weakens the insurance logic of the program and public confidence in its fairness. This creates space for modest, lifetime-based benefit moderation at the top without means testing or benefit cuts for typical workers.

This proposal addresses all three issues directly while protecting current retirees and preserving Social Security as a work-based social insurance program.

### 2. What is this proposal not?

This is a modernization of Social Security, not a replacement. It keeps the earned-benefit structure intact and preserves the program’s insurance role. It relies on a few simple, durable levers rather than annual means testing or wealth taxes. The goal is a system people can understand and trust over time.

- Not privatization or private accounts.
- Not annual means testing or wealth testing.
- Not a benefit cut for typical workers.

---

### 3. Is this a benefit cut?

For most workers, **no**.

- Scheduled benefits for typical earners are unchanged.
- Low-income, long-career workers are better protected.
- Changes at the top apply gradually, over a lifetime, and without cliffs.

The goal is not to reduce Social Security’s role, but to make it financially durable and fairer across modern careers.

Example: A long-career, middle-income worker who has paid in steadily sees scheduled benefits unchanged. The main gain is stability: restoring solvency reduces the risk of sudden, crisis-driven cuts for workers who are counting on those benefits. It preserves the promise they have earned without changing how their benefit is calculated.

---

### 4. How does this proposal restore long-term solvency?

This proposal targets **full 75-year solvency** with a small number of high-leverage, structurally simple changes:

1. Applying payroll taxes to all wages.
2. Moderating benefit growth for very high lifetime earners.
3. Gradually adjusting retirement age for younger cohorts.
4. Preventing systematic underpayment of payroll taxes by high earners.
5. Strengthening minimum benefits for long-career low earners.

These elements are designed to work together and can be calibrated over time.

---

### 5. Why this approach instead of a temporary patch or crisis compromise?

Under current law, scheduled benefits face automatic reductions in the mid-2030s when reserves run short. This approach prevents that outcome by using a small number of durable levers rather than repeated short-term fixes.

- It avoids annual means testing and preserves the earned-benefit structure.
- It protects the payroll base through cap removal and MCR leakage prevention.
- It is designed so calibration can change without reopening the structure.

The result is a modernized system that can be adjusted over time without crisis-driven deals.

---

### 6. What changes on the payroll tax side?

The current cap on wages subject to the Social Security payroll tax is removed.

- The full **12.4% OASDI payroll tax** applies to **all wage income**.
- This change applies only to the tax side of the system.
- It does not automatically grant unlimited additional benefits.

Removing the cap reflects modern wage concentration and is one of the most effective ways to strengthen Social Security’s finances.

---

### 7. Does removing the payroll tax cap mean very high earners get much larger benefits?

No.

Benefit accrual above today’s taxable maximum is **explicitly limited**.

This proposal separates:
- contribution fairness (payroll taxes apply to all wages), from
- benefit scaling (which remains progressive and capped).

This preserves Social Security’s insurance character rather than turning it into an unlimited earnings-linked annuity.

Example: A high-earning executive pays payroll tax on all wages once the cap is removed. Benefits still accrue normally up to today’s taxable maximum. Above that level, additional benefit growth is limited and can phase down for very high lifetime earners. This prevents unlimited benefit growth while strengthening solvency. The contributions are higher, but the benefit structure remains insurance-based and capped.

---

### 8. How are benefits adjusted for very high earners?

Instead of annual means testing, this proposal uses a **lifetime earnings–based benefit phase-down**.

- Benefits are evaluated based on lifetime indexed covered earnings.
- Benefits phase down linearly for very high lifetime earners.
- There are no cliffs, and reductions are capped.

Exact thresholds and percentages are calibration choices and intentionally left open.

Illustrative calibration (subject to adjustment)

- Full scheduled accrual up to approximately $4 million in lifetime indexed covered earnings.
- A linear phase-down from approximately $4 million to approximately $10 million.
- By approximately $10 million, additional accrual reaches zero.
- Total benefit reduction capped at roughly 25 percent relative to scheduled benefits.

Zero additional accrual does not eliminate benefits already earned under the existing formula.

Example: Two people earn similar totals over their careers, one with a late spike and one with steady income. The lifetime measure treats them similarly, so benefit adjustments track total lifetime earnings rather than a single high-income year.

Example: A high-earning professional pays payroll tax on all wages once the cap is removed. Benefits do not scale without limit, and additional accrual can phase down only at extremely high lifetime earnings levels, so their quality of life remains very comfortable. This is about maintaining Social Security’s insurance design and legitimacy, not punishment.

---

### 9. Why use lifetime earnings instead of annual income or wealth testing?

Lifetime measures are harder to game, more consistent with Social Security’s contributory design, and better aligned with modern, non-linear careers.

Annual income or wealth testing introduces complexity, administrative discretion, and political instability. This proposal avoids those pitfalls while still moderating benefits at the very top.

---

### 10. What protections are included for low-income workers?

The proposal strengthens the **minimum benefit** for long-career low earners.

Illustratively:
- Eligibility after ~30 years of covered earnings.
- A minimum benefit around **125% of the Federal Poverty Level**.
- Partial credit for workers with 10–29 years of coverage.

This ensures that long participation in the workforce reliably protects against old-age poverty.

Example: A home health aide who works most years at low wages gains a more reliable floor in retirement, reflecting long participation even with modest earnings. A short-career worker does not receive the same floor.

---

### 11. Does this proposal raise the retirement age?

Gradually, and only for younger cohorts.

**Why:** Americans are living longer in retirement than prior generations. The Social Security Trustees’ period life expectancy table shows that remaining life expectancy at age 65 increased from about 15.0 years for men and 19.0 years for women in 1990 to about 18.3 and 20.9 years in 2024.¹ Meanwhile, the average retirement age in the U.S. is already in the mid-60s for men and the low-60s for women.² A very slow FRA adjustment reflects these realities and improves long-run solvency without shocks.

**How (illustrative mechanics):**
- Applies only to workers below a defined age at enactment (illustratively, under age 45).
- For affected cohorts, the Full Retirement Age increases at a rate of one month every two years.
- The increase is capped at a total of 12 months.
- Current retirees and near-retirees are fully protected.

Example: If enacted in 2026, a 50-year-old sees no change. A 30-year-old sees a small, predictable increase over time, measured in months, not years. The total increase is capped so the adjustment cannot expand indefinitely.

### 12. How does this proposal handle income recharacterization and avoidance?

This proposal uses a **Universal Market Compensation Requirement (MCR)** to protect Social Security’s contributory base.

High earners can currently avoid payroll taxes by recharacterizing labor income as S-corp distributions, partnership profits, or carried interest. The MCR addresses this directly.

---

### 13. What is the Market Compensation Requirement?

The MCR is a single, mechanical rule that ensures a baseline amount of income is treated as labor income for Social Security purposes when individuals control or manage closely held businesses.

---

### 14. How is the MCR calculated?

Illustrative calibration (subject to adjustment)

The current floor amounts ($75,000 single; $150,000 married) and the 35% three-year smoothed profit share are illustrative starting points. These parameters can be tuned without changing the core structure of the rule. Tunable parameters include floor amounts, the profit-share percentage, the averaging window length and treatment of boundary years, the ownership or control threshold for applicability, and the definition of a capital-dominant safe harbor. Tuning should be guided by Social Security revenue integrity, simplicity, and minimizing gaming.

**MCR = max(A, B)**

**A) Floor**
- $75,000 (single)
- $150,000 (married)

**B) Smoothed profit share**
- **35% of average net profit over the most recent three qualifying years**, including the current year.

Boundary conditions are handled mechanically for first-year businesses, early years with limited history, exit or sale years, and temporary health or caregiving interruptions.

Example: A small business owner pays a modest salary but takes most income as distributions. The MCR treats a baseline portion as labor income for payroll taxes, while remaining profit keeps its character.

---

### 15. How does the MCR interact with benefits?

Income up to the MCR is treated as labor income, subject to payroll taxes, and counts toward Social Security benefits (subject to high-earner phase-down). Income above the MCR retains its assigned tax character.

The rule applies consistently to S-corp owners, professional partnerships, and carried interest.

---

### 16. Does this proposal include capital gains in Social Security?

No.

Social Security remains a **labor-based insurance system**. Capital gains do not count toward contributions or benefits and are addressed through the tax system in Phase 1.

---

### 17. What about low-income self-employed workers?

This proposal does not reduce payroll tax rates or create special carve-outs. Relief for low-income workers comes through lower income tax rates at the bottom and a stronger Social Security minimum benefit.

---

### 18. How does this interact with the Phase 1 tax reforms?

The two phases are designed together:

- Phase 1 closes income and capital-gains avoidance pathways.
- Phase 2 ensures those pathways cannot be used to underpay Social Security contributions.
- Lifetime accounting is used consistently across both systems.

Rates and thresholds can be calibrated jointly over time.

---

### 19. What is intentionally left open?

This proposal fixes **structure first**, not final numbers.

Open calibration questions include:
- Lifetime earnings thresholds for benefit phase-down.
- Maximum benefit reduction at the top.
- Retirement-age cohort cutoffs.
- Specific MCR parameters and safe harbors.

---

### 20. Why not replace Social Security with private retirement accounts?

Private accounts have appeal: investment growth and personal ownership. But the central problem is transition financing: promised benefits to current retirees and near-retirees still must be paid, and diverting payroll taxes to private accounts creates a large funding gap that must be filled by higher taxes, borrowing, or benefit cuts.³

Private accounts also add market and timing risk near retirement, while Social Security provides inflation-protected lifetime income plus survivor and disability protection. Managing millions of small accounts adds administrative costs and complexity compared with a centralized system.⁴

Social Security is largely pay-as-you-go, so demographics and wage concentration matter, but that is different from a pyramid scheme because it is a transparent, legislated social insurance system. Even after trust fund depletion, benefits do not drop to zero; payments continue at the level supported by incoming revenue.³

Public support for protecting benefits is strong, which makes durable solvency fixes more credible than privatization.⁵

This proposal fixes solvency and integrity while keeping the simple, durable insurance core.

### Relationship to the Project Overview

This document is a **child document** of the Fair & Simple Tax Act Project Overview. It applies the shared design tenets described there—radical simplicity, lifetime fairness, and fiscal durability—to the Social Security system specifically.

Tax reform (Phase 1) and Social Security modernization (Phase 2) are presented as separate PR-FAQs to allow focused analysis and debate. Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

### Overview

This document describes **Phase 2** of the Fair & Simple Tax Act: a targeted modernization of Social Security designed to restore long-term solvency, improve fairness across modern careers, and close entitlement-related loopholes while preserving the core contributory structure of the program.

Phase 2 is narrower in scope than Phase 1. Social Security is fundamentally sound and needs modernization and leakage prevention, not wholesale redesign.

## Frequently Asked Questions



### 1. What problem is this reform trying to solve?

1. What problem is this reform trying to solve?
Social Security faces three concrete, well-documented structural problems under current law.

**First, the program is on a clear path to long-term insolvency.**
According to the Social Security Trustees, the combined trust funds are projected to be depleted in the mid-2030s. At that point, incoming payroll taxes would cover only about 75–80% of scheduled benefits, triggering automatic benefit reductions absent legislative action. Over the standard 75-year projection window, the actuarial shortfall is roughly 3.5% of taxable payroll, a gap driven primarily by demographic change and the growing concentration of wages above the payroll tax cap.[^1]
[^1]: Social Security Administration, *Trustees Report*, projected depletion ~2033–2035.

**Second, a meaningful share of labor income at the top escapes payroll taxation entirely.**
High-income individuals increasingly earn through S-corporations, partnerships, and similar pass-through entities that allow labor income to be legally recharacterized as business profits or investment returns. While lawful, this systematically reduces payroll tax contributions from those with the greatest ability to pay and weakens the contributory integrity of the system. Treasury and IRS analyses suggest this leakage plausibly amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year, large enough to materially worsen long-run solvency even if precise estimates vary.[^2]
[^2]: Estimates of payroll tax leakage from pass-through income vary, but multiple Treasury and academic analyses find large and growing gaps driven by S-corp and partnership structures. See, for example:
U.S. Department of the Treasury, Taxation of Pass-Through Business Income
Joint Committee on Taxation, Present Law and Selected Policy Issues in the Taxation of Pass-Through Entities
Smith et al., Pass-Through Income and Payroll Tax Avoidance, National Tax Journal.

**Third, benefit scaling at very high lifetime earnings no longer serves a clear insurance purpose.**
Under current law, individuals with extremely high lifetime earnings continue to receive Social Security benefits that are small relative to their total retirement resources but meaningful in aggregate. While this is not a dominant cost driver, it weakens the insurance logic of the program and public confidence in its fairness. This creates space for modest, lifetime-based benefit moderation at the top without means testing or benefit cuts for typical workers.

This proposal addresses all three issues directly while protecting current retirees and preserving Social Security as a work-based social insurance program.


### 2. Is this a benefit cut?

For most workers, **no**.

- Scheduled benefits for typical earners are unchanged.
- Low-income, long-career workers are better protected.
- Changes at the top apply gradually, over a lifetime, and without cliffs.

The goal is not to reduce Social Security’s role, but to make it financially durable and fairer across modern careers.

Example: A mid-career worker who has paid in steadily sees scheduled benefits unchanged, while the changes focus on very high lifetime earners. For someone with modest wages, the main impact is a stronger minimum protection later on.

---

### 3. How does this proposal restore long-term solvency?

This proposal targets **full 75-year solvency** with a small number of high-leverage, structurally simple changes:

1. Applying payroll taxes to all wages.
2. Moderating benefit growth for very high lifetime earners.
3. Gradually adjusting retirement age for younger cohorts.
4. Preventing systematic underpayment of payroll taxes by high earners.
5. Strengthening minimum benefits for long-career low earners.

These elements are designed to work together and can be calibrated over time.

---

### 4. What changes on the payroll tax side?

The current cap on wages subject to the Social Security payroll tax is removed.

- The full **12.4% OASDI payroll tax** applies to **all wage income**.
- This change applies only to the tax side of the system.
- It does not automatically grant unlimited additional benefits.

Removing the cap reflects modern wage concentration and is one of the most effective ways to strengthen Social Security’s finances.

---

### 5. Does removing the payroll tax cap mean very high earners get much larger benefits?

No.

Benefit accrual above today’s taxable maximum is **explicitly limited**.

This proposal separates:
- contribution fairness (payroll taxes apply to all wages), from
- benefit scaling (which remains progressive and capped).

This preserves Social Security’s insurance character rather than turning it into an unlimited earnings-linked annuity.

Example: A high-earning executive pays payroll tax on all wages, but the benefit formula still flattens at the top. Contributions rise without creating a limitless benefit.

---

### 6. How are benefits adjusted for very high earners?

Instead of annual means testing, this proposal uses a **lifetime earnings–based benefit phase-down**.

- Benefits are evaluated based on lifetime indexed covered earnings.
- Benefits phase down linearly for very high lifetime earners.
- There are no cliffs, and reductions are capped.

Exact thresholds and percentages are calibration choices and intentionally left open.

Example: Two people earn similar totals over their careers, one with a late spike and one with steady income. The lifetime measure treats them similarly, so benefit adjustments track total lifetime earnings rather than a single high-income year.

---

### 7. Why use lifetime earnings instead of annual income or wealth testing?

Lifetime measures are harder to game, more consistent with Social Security’s contributory design, and better aligned with modern, non-linear careers.

Annual income or wealth testing introduces complexity, administrative discretion, and political instability. This proposal avoids those pitfalls while still moderating benefits at the very top.

---

### 8. What protections are included for low-income workers?

The proposal strengthens the **minimum benefit** for long-career low earners.

Illustratively:
- Eligibility after ~30 years of covered earnings.
- A minimum benefit around **125% of the Federal Poverty Level**.
- Partial credit for workers with 10–29 years of coverage.

This ensures that long participation in the workforce reliably protects against old-age poverty.

Example: A home health aide who works most years at low wages gains a more reliable floor in retirement, reflecting long participation even with modest earnings. A short-career worker does not receive the same floor.

---

### 9. Does this proposal raise the retirement age?

Gradually, and only for younger cohorts.

- Applies only to workers below a defined age at enactment.
- Increases occur very slowly (e.g., one month every two years).
- Total increase is capped.

Current retirees and near-retirees are fully protected.

---

### 10. How does this proposal handle income recharacterization and avoidance?

This proposal uses a **Universal Market Compensation Requirement (MCR)** to protect Social Security’s contributory base.

High earners can currently avoid payroll taxes by recharacterizing labor income as S-corp distributions, partnership profits, or carried interest. The MCR addresses this directly.

---

### 11. What is the Market Compensation Requirement?

The MCR is a single, mechanical rule that ensures a baseline amount of income is treated as labor income for Social Security purposes when individuals control or manage closely held businesses.

---

### 12. How is the MCR calculated?

Illustrative calibration (subject to adjustment)

The current floor amounts ($75,000 single; $150,000 married) and the 35% three-year smoothed profit share are illustrative starting points. These parameters can be tuned without changing the core structure of the rule. Tunable parameters include floor amounts, the profit-share percentage, the averaging window length and treatment of boundary years, the ownership or control threshold for applicability, and the definition of a capital-dominant safe harbor. Tuning should be guided by Social Security revenue integrity, simplicity, and minimizing gaming.

**MCR = max(A, B)**

**A) Floor**
- $75,000 (single)
- $150,000 (married)

**B) Smoothed profit share**
- **35% of average net profit over the most recent three qualifying years**, including the current year.

Boundary conditions are handled mechanically for first-year businesses, early years with limited history, exit or sale years, and temporary health or caregiving interruptions.

Example: A small business owner pays a modest salary but takes most income as distributions. The MCR treats a baseline portion as labor income for payroll taxes, while remaining profit keeps its character.

---

### 13. How does the MCR interact with benefits?

Income up to the MCR is treated as labor income, subject to payroll taxes, and counts toward Social Security benefits (subject to high-earner phase-down). Income above the MCR retains its assigned tax character.

The rule applies consistently to S-corp owners, professional partnerships, and carried interest.

---

### 14. Does this proposal include capital gains in Social Security?

No.

Social Security remains a **labor-based insurance system**. Capital gains do not count toward contributions or benefits and are addressed through the tax system in Phase 1.

---

### 15. What about low-income self-employed workers?

This proposal does not reduce payroll tax rates or create special carve-outs. Relief for low-income workers comes through lower income tax rates at the bottom and a stronger Social Security minimum benefit.

---

### 16. How does this interact with the Phase 1 tax reforms?

The two phases are designed together:

- Phase 1 closes income and capital-gains avoidance pathways.
- Phase 2 ensures those pathways cannot be used to underpay Social Security contributions.
- Lifetime accounting is used consistently across both systems.

Rates and thresholds can be calibrated jointly over time.

---

### 17. What is intentionally left open?

This proposal fixes **structure first**, not final numbers.

Open calibration questions include:
- Lifetime earnings thresholds for benefit phase-down.
- Maximum benefit reduction at the top.
- Retirement-age cohort cutoffs.
- Specific MCR parameters and safe harbors.

---

### 18. What is this proposal not?

- Not a wealth tax.
- Not annual means testing.
- Not a benefit cut for typical workers.
- Not a privatization scheme.

It is a modernization of a 1930s system for a 21st-century economy, using simple rules and lifetime measures.

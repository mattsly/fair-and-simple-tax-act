A few strong data points to consider adding:

**Tax Compliance Confidence:**
- IRS data shows ~40% of filers use professional tax prep services (H&R Block, tax attorneys, CPAs)
- Survey data: Only ~30% of Americans say they "fully understand" their tax obligations
- Gallup/AARP polls show majority of Americans find tax code "too complicated"

**Time Burden:**
- IRS estimates 7.1 billion hours annually on tax compliance (you cite this)
- That's roughly 21 hours per household per year
- Adds up to ~$213B in economic value lost to compliance alone

**Tax Gap:**
- IRS reports $600B+ annual "tax gap" (taxes owed but uncollected)
- Higher on capital gains and business income due to complexity
- Simplification directly improves collection rates

**Error Rates:**
- IRS audit data shows higher error rates on itemized deductions and complex credits
- EITC error rate ~24% (overpayment or underpayment)
- Simplification reduces these administrative errors

**Key Sources to Cite:**
- IRS Data Book (annual, public)
- Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances
- Brookings Institution reports on tax compliance
- Tax Foundation studies on compliance burden

I'd recommend adding a sentence or two around **line 3-4** of the press release noting: *"[X]% of Americans lack confidence in their tax filing, and the average household spends 21 hours annually on compliance."* This sets emotional stakes before launching into policy.

### Q19 passthrough draft (15% annual capital return) — condensed summary

* Proposed a 15% annual capital-return allowance (up to 10 years) on documented owner capital; excess profit taxed as ordinary income; capital-return amounts counted against the $1.5M lifetime exemption; capital gains at exit still available.
* Goal: end S-corp wage/distribution arbitrage, curb carried-interest treatment, and reward documented risk-taking; S-corp vs LLC choice becomes tax-neutral.
* Examples showed ~31% effective rates on $500K profit with $200K invested; modest revenue gain from closing arbitrage (~$15–25B net after allowing the preference).
* Mechanics: salary optimization becomes irrelevant; allowance expires after 10 years; “use it or lose it” each year; lifetime exemption brake limits double-dipping.

### Why we didn’t adopt the 15% capital-return approach

* **Complexity vs. simplicity goal:** Annual capital-base tracking, documentation tests, and 10-year timers add moving parts; harder to message than a salary floor plus a single residual allowance percentage.
* **Audit/gaming risk:** Fair-market-value disputes on contributed property; timing games on capital infusions; pressure to inflate basis to grow the 15% benefit.
* **Uneven by business type:** Capital-heavy firms benefit more than sweat-heavy firms; we want a uniform rule for founders, professionals, and small services.
* **Overlap with lifetime exemption:** Annual capital-return amounts already consume the exemption, but still invite double counting debates and recordkeeping friction.
* **Fiscal uncertainty:** Revenue swing depends on capital-basis assertions; harder to bound than a flat residual percentage with a salary floor.
* **Cleaner alternative chosen:** The $120K compensation floor + 20% residual sweat-equity allowance (counting against the lifetime exemption) gives parity or better outcomes with fewer calculations and clearer guardrails.

The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a proposal to refactor the U.S. tax code based on three fundamental tenets.

These proposals below are intentionally written in an [Amazon-style "Working Backwards" PR-FAQ format](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes) by [Matt Sly](https://wwww.mattsly.com). I spent much of my career in technology and product development, where this format is commonly used to present complex ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.

I am not a career policy professional. I’m a software entrepreneur approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.

Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

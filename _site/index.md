The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a series of indepedant but thematically related proposals to refactor U.S. fiscal policy.

### Why This Matters
The U.S. tax system raises revenue in ways that are opaque, uneven, and increasingly disconnected from how Americans actually earn money and build wealth. It punishes work more reliably than wealth, rewards financial engineering over productive activity, and requires an entire parallel industry just to navigate it. The result is a system that is widely resented, poorly understood, and politically brittle.

At the same time, we are heading into a decade defined by two unavoidable realities:
1. An aging population that will put sustained pressure on Social Security and Medicare
2. A labor market that looks nothing like the one the tax code was designed for

Layering new credits on top of old deductions, or carving out yet another exception, only deepens the problem. Complexity itself has become a form of unfairness.

This proposal starts from a different premise:

If the tax code were simple, durable, and legible to ordinary citizens, many downstream problems would become easier to solve.

Phase 1 modernizes how we tax income and capital so that work, saving, and entrepreneurship are treated consistently and transparently.

Phase 2 strengthens Social Security by broadening its funding base in a way that reflects today’s economy, without cutting benefits for typical workers.

The goal is not to “win” a partisan argument or to optimize for a single constituency. It’s to build a tax system that can plausibly last: one that people can understand, comply with, and debate honestly.

A tax system that no one trusts cannot sustain a democratic society for long. This is an attempt to rebuild that trust, starting with the fundamentals.

The policy design is based on three fundamental tenets. These tenets will be referenced throughout, and are included in each independant proposal.

## Proposals

These proposals are intentionally written in an [Amazon-style "Working Backwards" PR-FAQ format](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes) by [Matt Sly](https://wwww.mattsly.com). I spent much of my career in technology and product development and wrote many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.

As a major caveat - I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I am approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.

Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

#### [Phase 1: Income Tax Reform](phase_1_income_tax_reform_pr_faq.md) Eliminate loopholes and complexity, introduce new top bracket, universal child credit, and a **Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance** with a lifetime rate table. 

#### [Phase 2: Social Security Modernization](phase_2_social_security_modernization_pr_faq.md): Restore solvency and protect current and future retirees.

#### Phase 3: American Opportunity Accounts (Coming Soon)

## Fiscal Sustainability Summary

This project is designed to be additive across phases, but it does not replace the need for spending reform.

### **Current Fiscal Baseline (Illustrative)**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | ~\$1.7T (~6% of GDP) | ~\$840B–1.14T (3–4% of GDP) | ~\$600B–1.12T annually |
| **Over 10 Years** | ~\$17T of deficit | ~\$8.4T–11.4T sustainable | Need to reduce by ~$6.0T–11.2T |

### **Project Impact (Illustrative Annual)**

| Component | Annual Impact | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1** | **\$200–310B** | Base‑broadening and loophole closure |
| **Phase 2** | **\$310–350B** | Long‑run Social Security gap reduction (steady‑state, illustrative) |
| **Interest Savings** | **\$20–50B (near‑term)** | Scales over time with debt avoided and rates |

### **What Remains**

On optimistic assumptions, Phase 1 + Phase 2 + interest savings can close most (or even all) of the near‑term deficit gap. On conservative assumptions, a meaningful gap remains, so **targeted spending cuts and modernization** are still likely needed.

*Note:* Interest savings are small in the early years and grow as avoided debt accumulates. A simple rule of thumb is **interest savings ≈ cumulative debt avoided × average interest rate**.
Example (10‑year, 4%): avoiding $6T of cumulative borrowing implies roughly **$240B/year** in interest savings once fully phased in.

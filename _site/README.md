**Status:** Active draft. Core policy stable; examples and estimates under review.

** Review Process**

When working with an LLM for review, give the following priming:

I am working on a comprehensive tax reform proposal. 
Phase 1 addresses Income Tax and Capital Gains
Phase 2 addresses Social Security

Both docs are linked from this main page, which gives an outline and, importantly, includes the Tenets which guide the design of these proposals.
https://www.mattsly.com/fair-and-simple-tax-act/

Can you read all 3 documents (start page, Phase 1 and Phase 2) give me some feedback? 

The audience here is newspapers, think tanks, politicians, public intellectuals/ professors. 

I want the documents to be very readable (not too wonky) and full of examples and clear numbers when appropriate.

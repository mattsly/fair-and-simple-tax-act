      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">The Fair & Simple Tax Act</a></h1>
      

      
<p>These proposals below are intentionally written in an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes">Amazon-style “Working Backwards” PR-FAQ format</a> by <a href="https://wwww.mattsly.com">Matt Sly</a>. I spent much of my career in technology and product development and wrote many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.</p>

<p>As a major caveat - I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I am approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.</p>

<p>Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.</p>

<p>The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a series of indepedant but thematically related proposals to refactor the U.S. tax code based on three fundamental tenets. These tenets will be referenced throughout, and are included in each independant proposal.</p>

<h2 id="tenets">Tenets</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Radical Simplicity:</strong> The tax code should be clearly explainable and ideally automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, reduces economic deadweight loss, and limits loopholes (raising revenue). Every tax paying American should have a strong understanding of how the tax code works and what the key levers are. With a more broadly understood tax code with a smaller number key levers, we enable more meaningful public debate about our tradeoffs and priorities. By reducing the tax code to a few transparent levers, we shift the power from specialists back to citizens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit):</strong> The tax code and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security. It should not reward financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiscal Durability:</strong> The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic changes. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. An adequately durable systems will reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls. We aim to be agnostic about revenues versus costs and prioritize the most effective path to fiscal health while codifying core American values.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="what-remains"><strong>What Remains</strong></h3>

<p>On optimistic assumptions, Phase 1 + Phase 2 + interest savings can close most (or even all) of the near‑term deficit gap. On conservative assumptions, a meaningful gap remains, so <strong>targeted spending cuts and modernization</strong> are still likely needed.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Interest savings are small in the early years and grow as avoided debt accumulates. A simple rule of thumb is <strong>interest savings ≈ cumulative debt avoided × average interest rate</strong>.
Example (10‑year, 4%): avoiding $6T of cumulative borrowing implies roughly <strong>$240B/year</strong> in interest savings once fully phased in.</p>

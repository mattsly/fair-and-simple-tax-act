      <h1 id="the-fair--simple-tax-act">The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act</h1>

<p><strong>A two-phase proposal to modernize how America raises revenue and funds earned benefits.</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. tax system is overly complex, opaque, and increasingly optimized for strategies that concentrate wealth rather than broadly reward work, saving, and productive investment.</p>

<p>This project proposes a cleaner, more durable alternative designed to be legible to citizens and usable by policymakers.</p>

  <p><em>The proposals are written in an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes">Amazon-style “Working Backwards” PR-FAQ format</a> I spent much of my career in technology and product development and have written many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.</em></p>

<h3 id="phase-1-income--capital-gains"><strong>Phase 1: Income &amp; Capital Gains</strong></h3>
<p>A structural redesign of the income and capital gains tax system that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplifies brackets and eliminates major carve-outs</li>
  <li>Introduces a lifetime capital gains framework</li>
  <li>Consolidates family benefits</li>
  <li>Closes buy–borrow–die mechanics</li>
  <li>Reduces compliance and tax-planning overhead</li>
  <li>Net revenue-positive over the long term, raising several hundred billion dollars annually and closing a meaningful share of the structural federal deficit through base broadening and reduced avoidance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="phase-2-social-security"><strong>Phase 2: Social Security</strong></h3>
<p>A modernization of Social Security financing that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Broadens the contribution base to reflect today’s economy</li>
  <li>Preserves scheduled benefits for typical earners</li>
  <li>Improves long-term solvency without benefit cuts</li>
  <li>Treats wage earners and business owners more consistently</li>
  <li>Restores Social Security to long-term solvency on a 75-year horizon without reducing scheduled benefits for typical earners.</li>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The U.S. tax system isn’t just complicated. It is structurally misaligned with the economy and society it is meant to serve.</p>

<p>Over time, three deep problems have emerged.</p>

<p><strong>First, the system has become too complex to understand, explain, or govern.</strong><br />
What began as a set of pragmatic rules has grown into a dense web of deductions, credits, exceptions, and phase-outs. Complexity is not neutral. It shifts power toward specialists, raises compliance costs, and makes honest public debate about tradeoffs nearly impossible. When a tax system requires professional mediation to navigate, it stops being democratically legible. Trust erodes not because people disagree with outcomes, but because they cannot reason about the system at all.</p>

<p><strong>Second, the system no longer treats income and wealth accumulation coherently.</strong><br />
Labor income is taxed early and often, while large asset gains can compound for decades with little or no taxation. Similar economic outcomes are treated very differently depending on form, timing, and sophistication. This asymmetry rewards financial engineering over productive activity and contributes to persistent wealth concentration that undermines economic mobility and opportunity. The issue is not any single tax rate. It is that the structure no longer aligns incentives with broadly shared growth.</p>

<p><strong>Third, the current structure makes long-term fiscal balance harder, not easier.</strong><br />
An aging population, rising interest costs, and persistent deficits leave little room for error. Yet the tax code relies on narrow bases, temporary provisions, and optimistic assumptions. Systems that are complex, brittle, and fiscally unbalanced do not fail all at once. They fail through gradual loss of credibility, followed by crisis-driven fixes that are harder and more divisive than thoughtful reform would have been.</p>

<p>These problems point to a clear conclusion: continuing to layer new credits, deductions, and exceptions onto the existing system will not resolve its underlying failures. Over time, that approach has increased complexity without improving fairness or durability.</p>

<p>This proposal focuses on structural reform within the existing income and capital gains framework. A simpler, more coherent, and fiscally durable system is not just easier to comply with—it is fairer, more enforceable, and more likely to endure.
That leads to three design commitments:</p>

<p>These conclusions inform three core design tenets that guide both phases of the proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Radical Simplicity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fiscal Durability</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Each tenet is defined in detail and applied consistently across Phase 1 and Phase 2.</p>

<p>The goal is not to win a partisan argument or optimize for a single constituency. It is to refactor a system that has accumulated too much accidental complexity and too many hidden tradeoffs.</p>

<p>A tax system that people cannot understand cannot sustain trust.<br />
A system that cannot balance over time cannot sustain a republic.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to fix both.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-project">About This Project</h2>

<p>These proposals are by <a href="https://wwww.mattsly.com">Matt Sly</a>. I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I’ve paid taxes in many roles—student, teacher, employee, founder, executive, investor, parent—and seen the system from multiple angles.</p>

<p>I’m a systems thinker and product builder by background, and I approach the tax code the same way I would a complex software system that has accumulated too much accidental complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.</p>

<p>This project is not affiliated with a political party, campaign, or institution. It is an attempt to apply systems thinking, real-world experience, and clear tradeoffs to a problem that sits at the intersection of economics, equity, and long-term national health.</p>

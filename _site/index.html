      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">The Fair & Simple Tax Act</a></h1>
      

      
<p>The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a proposal to refactor the U.S. tax code based on three fundamental tenets.</p>

<h2 id="tenets">Tenets</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Radical Simplicity:</strong> The tax code should be clearly explainable and ideally automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, economic deadweight loss, limits loopholes (raising revenue). With a less obscure tax code with a few key levers, we enable more meaningful public debate about tradeoffs and priorities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit):</strong> The tax code and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security, not financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiscal Durability:</strong> The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic change. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. Durable systems reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls. We aim to be agnostic about revenues versus costs and prioritize the most effective path to fiscal health while codifying core American values.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These proposals below are intentionally written in an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes">Amazon-style “Working Backwards” PR-FAQ format</a> by <a href="https://wwww.mattsly.com">Matt Sly</a>. I spent much of my career in technology and product development, where this format is commonly used to present complex ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.</p>

<p>I am not a career policy professional. I’m a software entrepreneur approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.</p>

<p>Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.</p>

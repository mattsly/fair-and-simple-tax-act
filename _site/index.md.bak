# **Press Release**

### **A radically simplified tax code that supports upward mobility and puts the nation on a path toward a balanced budget**

**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The U.S. tax code has grown so complex that it has become a black box. Most Americans are left 'you owe what you owe' without any clear understanding of how policy choices translate into real costs, benefits, or tradeoffs.

It’s 2025\. We can do better.

Today, bipartisan leaders introduced the Fair & Simple Tax Act, a comprehensive reform built on a straightforward idea: the tax system should be simple enough for ordinary citizens to understand and transparent enough to support honest democratic debate.

### **Why simplicity matters**

A simpler tax code isn’t just about convenience — it’s about democracy.

When tax rules are opaque, public debate breaks down. Citizens can’t meaningfully weigh the costs and benefits of government programs if the revenue system itself is incomprehensible. Complexity becomes a substitute for consent.

By dramatically simplifying the tax code and making it understandable to anyone, the Fair & Simple Tax Act restores transparency. With fewer moving parts and fewer hidden rules, Americans can once again have productive conversations about shared priorities — what we want government to do, and what we are willing to pay for it.

The current Internal Revenue Code spans 2,600 pages of statute and 10,000 pages of Treasury regulations. The Fair & Simple Tax Act reduces this to fewer than 200 pages of primary statutory text — a 95% reduction in complexity.

### **What this bill does**

The vast majority of families earning under \$400,000 pay less. The reform is designed so that most households earning under \$400,000 face a lower federal tax bill than under current law through reduced income tax brackets, expanded child benefits, and closing loopholes for high earners and wealth accumulation.

Income taxes are dramatically simplified. The six simplified tax brackets replace a complex system with phase-outs, cliffs, and hidden preferences. Social Security's wage cap is eliminated, making it more progressive—high earners finally contribute on all income. Families earning under $250K see clear tax relief compared to today.

Saving becomes understandable. More than a dozen overlapping savings programs are replaced with one simple, universal account — flexible enough for all life stages, from education to homeownership to retirement.

Families receive clear, automatic support. Three child‑related programs become a single \$6,000 annual benefit per child (phasing out \$120K–\$400K), delivered automatically without paperwork.

Major loopholes are closed. The special rules that allow extreme wealth to avoid taxation — including stepped‑up basis at death, QSBS, NIIT, and buy‑borrow‑die strategies — are eliminated and replaced with a single, consistent system built around a lifetime capital gains exemption that applies uniformly across all asset types.

Tax filing becomes simple, automated, and largely hands‑off. Everyone still files a tax return, but for most Americans it is pre‑filled automatically. You log in, review the information, make changes if needed, and confirm — no complex forms, schedules, or professional preparation required.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces a black box with a system people can see, understand, and debate.

### **Meet in the Middle: Revenue Reform as Step 1**

This Act is revenue-positive from Day 1, generating $140–350B annually through loophole closures and base broadening. This represents the revenue side's contribution to fiscal sustainability — closing 16–60% of the gap between today's 6% of GDP deficit and the sustainable 3–4% target.

Now Congress needs to match that effort on spending: consolidate duplicative programs, means-test benefits for high earners, eliminate waste. Tax reform + spending reform + GDP growth = fiscal sustainability within 5–10 years. That's not just policy — that's partnership. (See Appendix C for the full fiscal strategy.)

### **What supporters are saying**

'This bill cuts through decades of complexity and replaces it with a system people can actually understand. A tax code this simple makes it harder to hide special favors and easier to hold the government accountable.'

— *Senior Democratic Senator*

'For too long, we’ve had a tax system that rewards lawyers and lobbyists instead of work, saving, and investment. This reform broadens the base, closes loopholes, and puts us on a more sustainable fiscal path.'

— *Senior Republican Senator*

'I don’t have a complicated tax situation — just a job, kids, and a mortgage. The idea that I could see my taxes clearly and not need an accountant every year is huge.'

— *Middle‑class parent, Ohio*

'As a small business owner, I want to spend time growing my company, not navigating tax rules. Fewer accounts, clearer rates, and no surprise carve‑outs would be a real improvement.'

— *Small business owner, Arizona*

# **Tenets**

1. **Radical Simplicity**: If a rule cannot be automated or clearly explained to a normal taxpayer, it does not belong in the tax code.  
2. **Fuel the Climb**: The system should help families build stability and wealth over time — not reward financial engineering or entrenched dynastic wealth that concentrates power across generations.  
3. **Fiscal Durability**: The reform is revenue-positive from Day 1 ($140–350B annually), closing loopholes and broadening the base so the tax system actually collects what it is owed — putting the nation on a sustainable path without relying on optimistic growth assumptions.

**Note:** This Act addresses the revenue side of the federal budget deficit. Achieving long-term fiscal balance requires parallel spending reforms built on the same tenets: simplicity, fairness, and durability. Tax reform and spending reform must move together. See [Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability](#appendix-c-path-to-fiscal-sustainability) for the full "meet in the middle" strategy.

## **Q2: How much simpler is this really?**

**95% simpler by page count.**

The current tax code:

* Internal Revenue Code: 2,600 pages
* Treasury Regulations: 10,000 pages
* Industry compilations (with annotations): 70,000+ pages

The Fair & Simple Tax Act:

* Core provisions: ~200 pages
* With transition rules: ~300-500 pages maximum

**What gets eliminated:**

* Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
* Itemized deductions (mortgage interest, SALT, charitable)
* 15+ retirement account types
* Dozens of credits and carve-outs (QSBS, carried interest, NIIT, etc.)
* Complex estate planning vehicles

**What automation enables:**

* Pre-filled returns for 95% of filers
* Third-party reporting closes loopholes automatically
* No forms, schedules, or professional preparation for most Americans

---

## **Q3: Who benefits and who pays more?**

### **The short answer**

* **Working and middle-class families:** pay less  
* **Upper-middle-class families under \$400K:** protected from increases  
* **Extreme wealth:** pays more, through broader bases and higher top-end rates  
* **Everyone:** saves time and money on compliance

### **The pattern**

* Lower income tax brackets provide a tax cut for most workers  
* Families with children benefit from automatic credits  
* Capital gains below \$1.5M are tax-free (replaces the primary residence exclusion with a universal lifetime exemption), progressive rates above that (15%/20%/27%/32%)  
* Very large incomes and very large fortunes contribute more

**In plain terms:**  
A nurse, a teacher, a small business owner, and a dual-income professional household all come out ahead. A nine-figure fortune pays more.

---

## **Q4: Is this plan fiscally responsible?**

Yes. The Fair & Simple Tax Act is **revenue-positive from Day 1**.

It achieves this by:

* Removing the Social Security wage cap (high earners pay on all wages): +$150-200B annually
* Carried interest reform (salary floor + 20% residual allowance; lifetime-exemption limited): +$50-80B gross (net reflects allowance cost below)
* Closing buy-borrow-die and other avoidance strategies: +$100-200B annually
* Broadening the tax base and reducing the tax gap through automation and third-party reporting: +$50-100B annually
* **Total: $350-580B in new annual revenue**

These gains fund lower income tax brackets for working and middle-class families, while maintaining overall fiscal responsibility.

Rather than relying on optimistic growth assumptions, the Act prioritizes **structural soundness**.

## **Part 2: Core Mechanics**

---

## **Q5: What happens to payroll taxes?**

Payroll taxes remain in place, but the Social Security wage cap is eliminated — making the system more progressive while strengthening its solvency.

The key change:

* **Social Security tax (6.2%):** Currently capped at ~$160,000 of annual wages. The Fair & Simple Tax Act removes this cap entirely. High earners now pay on all wages, same as everyone else.
* **Medicare tax (1.45%):** Unchanged (already uncapped)
* **Overall effect:** Social Security funding improves by $150-200 billion annually, extending solvency by at least 75 years under current demographic assumptions without raising rates or cutting benefits

**Why keep payroll taxes instead of consolidating them?**

Two compelling reasons:

1. **Statutory protection:** Social Security and Medicare funding are protected by statute from being raided for other purposes. Consolidating into general income tax would require creating new legislative protections.

2. **Wage cap removal accomplishes the goal:** Removing the wage cap (instead of restructuring) makes the system more progressive while preserving that protection.

Both approaches would work; we chose this one because it achieves progressivity while preserving Social Security's dedicated funding structure.

**Does this affect my benefits?**

No. Your Social Security benefit formula doesn't change. Higher-earning workers who now pay more in Social Security tax don't receive higher benefits—Social Security remains progressive on the benefit side (high earners get a lower replacement rate). The additional revenue purely extends the program's solvency.

Under current law, Social Security taxes apply only to wages up to approximately $160,000 (indexed annually). Above that threshold, workers and employers pay no Social Security tax — only Medicare tax continues.

**Example: Impact of Removing the Wage Cap**

* A worker earning $160,000 pays 6.2% Social Security tax = $9,920
* A worker earning $500,000 pays 6.2% Social Security tax = $31,000 (under current law, only $9,920, capped at wage threshold)
* A worker earning $2 million pays 6.2% Social Security tax = $124,000 (under current law, only $9,920)

This removes a regressive feature where million-dollar earners pay the same absolute amount as $160K earners.

**Does this mean Social Security benefits increase for high earners?**

No. Benefit formulas remain unchanged. High earners who pay more in Social Security tax do not receive proportionally higher benefits. Social Security remains progressive on the benefit side: it has a cap on benefits and a progressive replacement rate formula that favors lower earners.

This creates a simple policy: high earners contribute more because all income counts (no cap), but they receive moderate-income benefits (capped formula). This shores up Social Security's long-term funding without raising rates or cutting benefits for anyone.

---

## **Q6: How do the new income tax brackets work?**

The system uses **six clear brackets**, indexed annually for inflation.

For income taxes specifically:

* no phase-outs  
* no hidden cliffs  
* no alternative minimum taxes

*(Note: The child benefit phases out $120K–$400K separately; see Q10)*

Everyone knows their marginal rate. Everyone pays something. Families earning under $250K see clear tax relief compared to current law.

---

## **Q7: How are capital gains, dividends, and investment income taxed?**

We introduce a new paradigm to determine Capital Gains rates based on lifetime total of capital gains. This is both to encourage saving early in life, and to recognize that many gains occur after multiple years or investment.

### **Capital Gains (Asset Appreciation)**

| Cumulative Lifetime Gains |  Marginal Capital Gains Rate |
| ----- | ----- |
| \$0 – \$1.5M | **0%** |
| \$1.5M – \$3M | **15%** |
| \$3M – \$10M | **20%** |
| \$10M – \$50M | **27%** |
| \$50M+ | **32%** |

Key rules:

* Assets must be held **more than one year** to qualify  
* Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income  
* The exemption is **\$1.5M per person** — married couples filing jointly can combine exemptions for a **\$3M combined exemption**
* In divorce, each person retains whatever portion of their individual exemption remains unused
* The exemption applies across all assets — once you've used \$1.5M in gains, you're done

This structure protects ordinary wealth-building while ensuring very large gains contribute more.

### **Capital Losses**

* Capital losses can offset capital gains **without limit**
* Net capital losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to **\$3,000 per year** (same as current law)
* Unused losses **carry forward indefinitely** to future years
* No carryback to prior years

**Example:**
* Year 1: \$50K capital gains, \$80K capital losses = \$30K net loss
* Deduct \$3K against ordinary income in Year 1
* Carry forward \$27K to Year 2
* Year 2: \$20K capital gains - \$27K carried loss = \$7K net loss
* Deduct \$3K against ordinary income in Year 2, carry forward \$4K to Year 3

This matches current law and provides reasonable loss recognition without creating gaming opportunities.

### **Dividends (Investment Yield)**

* **Qualified dividends** — Taxed at capital gains rates (0%, 15%, 20%, 27%, 32% depending on cumulative capital gains), same as current law
* **Ordinary dividends** — Taxed as ordinary income
* **Exemption treatment:** Dividends do NOT count against the $1.5M lifetime exemption
* This preserves the exemption for actual capital appreciation (buy-and-hold growth), not recurring distributions

**Why this structure:**
- The exemption rewards patient capital and business growth, not income-harvesting
- Dividends are a corporate distribution decision, not a shareholder risk-taking decision
- Keeping preferential dividend rates prevents a tax hike on existing investors
- Simpler bookkeeping: all dividends at cap rates (whether they qualify or not), exemption reserved for appreciation gains

### **Interest Income**

* **Interest from municipal bonds** — Tax-exempt (no change from current law; protects public sector capital flows)
* **All other interest** — Taxed as ordinary income
* This maintains the traditional tax incentive for investing in state/local infrastructure

### **Carried Interest (Investment Manager Compensation)**

Carried interest has been a loophole allowing service compensation to be taxed as capital gains. Under Fair & Simple, it follows the same compensation-first rule as other sweat equity: a salary floor plus a capped residual allowance that counts against the lifetime exemption.

**What is carried interest?**

Investment managers typically receive two forms of compensation:

1. **Management fees** (usually 2%) — paid by limited partners, taxed as ordinary income
2. **Carried interest** ("carry") (usually 20%) — a share of the fund's profits, historically taxed as capital gains

The problem: Carried interest is **compensation for work**, not genuine capital investment. A fund manager contributes minimal capital but receives 20% of all profits through a partnership structure. The manager's share of these profits is economically equivalent to a performance bonus — but is taxed at capital gains rates (currently 15-20%) instead of ordinary income rates.

**Example: The gap**

* A PE fund manages $10 billion and generates $1 billion in profits
* The manager receives 20% carry = $200 million
* Under current law: Taxed at 20% capital gains rate = $40M in taxes, manager keeps $160M (80%)
* Ordinary-income equivalent: $74M at 37% → manager keeps $126M (63%)
* **Annual benefit from loophole: $34 million per manager**

This compounds across the industry. With roughly 2,500-3,000 active PE/hedge fund managers, the total annual revenue loss is approximately **$50-80 billion per year (gross)**.

**How the Fair & Simple Tax Act addresses this (aligned with sweat equity):**

* **Compensation floor:** At least $120K (indexed) must be taken as ordinary income/salary.
* **Residual allowance:** Exactly 20% of residual profits may be treated as capital gains, counting against the lifetime exemption; the rest is ordinary income.
* **Capital at risk:** Genuine GP capital contributions still receive capital gains treatment separately.
* **Lifetime brake:** Preferred portions consume the $1.5M lifetime exemption; above that, progressive capital gains rates apply.

**Example: PE Manager under Fair & Simple Tax Act**

* Carry stream: $200M
* Salary floor: $120K (ordinary)
* Residual allowance: 20% of profits eligible for cap-gains treatment, counts against remaining lifetime exemption
* Balance: Ordinary income at top bracket

**Why this matters:**

* Aligns finance with the same sweat-equity rules used for founders/SMBs — no finance-only carve-outs
* Ensures meaningful ordinary-income inclusion, while allowing capped upside tied to real performance
* Uses the lifetime exemption to prevent serial reclassification of labor income as gains

**Estimated revenue recovery:** Gross $50-80B; net reflects the allowance cost already accounted for in costs

### **Foreign Investments**

* Foreign dividends are taxed under the same rules as domestic dividends  
* Taxes paid abroad receive a dollar-for-dollar credit, capped at U.S. tax owed

## **Q8: What is the American Savings Account (ASA)?**

The ASA replaces more than 15 fragmented account types with one simple, universal account that behaves similarly to a ROTH IRA.

### **How it works**

* \$1,000 government seed at birth  
* Up to \$30,000 in annual contributions (after-tax, indexed — meaning it rises annually with inflation to preserve purchasing power)
* Tax-free growth

### **Withdrawals**

* **Contributions:** Withdraw anytime, tax-free, penalty-free  
* **Gains before age 60:** Taxed as capital gains, uses lifetime \$1.5M exemption  
* **Gains after age 60:** Up to \$2.5M in total withdrawals (indexed) are tax-free; gains above \$2.5M are taxed as capital gains

**Example:** You contribute \$2M over your lifetime. It grows to \$8M by age 65. You can withdraw \$2.5M tax-free after age 60. The remaining \$5.5M in gains are taxed as capital gains when withdrawn (using any remaining lifetime exemption, then at 15%/20%/27%/32% rates).

If you've used your full \$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption elsewhere before age 60, early withdrawal of gains is taxed at the applicable capital gains rate (15%/20%/27%/32% depending on your total lifetime gains).

### **What it replaces**

401(k)s, Traditional and Roth IRAs, SEPs, SIMPLE plans, 529 plans, Coverdell accounts, ABLE accounts, and similar programs.

### **Why one account?**

Complex savings systems disproportionately benefit higher-income households with advisors. One universal account increases participation, reduces administrative costs, and makes public subsidies for saving transparent and fair.

Even early withdrawals benefit from years of tax-free compounding. Leaving gains until age 60 provides maximum benefit.

## **Q9: What happens to my existing 401(k), IRA, or other legacy accounts?**

Most people should convert to the ASA. The financial case is compelling. But there's a 10-year transition window, and for those who don't convert, legacy accounts continue under modified rules.

### **The Conversion Offer: 12% One-Time Tax Rate**

Convert pre-tax retirement accounts (Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA, SEP, SIMPLE) to the ASA at a **one-time 12% tax rate**:

* The 12% applies only to **pre-tax contributions and gains** — after-tax contributions (like Roth accounts) convert with no additional tax
* Pay the tax in the year you convert (or spread conversions across multiple years to manage your tax bill)
* **Conversion does NOT count against your $1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption** — this is a separate, one-time transition tax
* Once converted, all future growth occurs tax-free under ASA rules
* This offer is only available for 10 years after the Act takes effect; after year 10, legacy accounts freeze to new contributions

### **The Lifetime Exemption Does NOT Apply to the Conversion**

This is critical to understand: The $1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption is entirely separate from the conversion tax.

* **The 12% conversion tax** is a separate, one-time transition tax applied to pre-tax account balances — it does not consume any part of your $1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption
* Your $1.5M exemption remains completely available for actual capital gains from investments, business sales, real estate, and future investments
* If your ASA account grows to $5M by retirement, the original conversion doesn't "use up" any of your exemption
* Instead, ASA withdrawal rules apply: tax-free growth until age 60 (up to $2.5M total), then capital gains rates apply to anything beyond $2.5M, using any remaining exemption

**Example of the distinction:**

* You have $500K in a Traditional 401(k) (entirely pre-tax contributions + gains)
* You convert it to ASA and pay 12% = $60K in taxes
* This $60K is a transition tax — it does NOT count against your $1.5M capital gains exemption
* Your exemption remains completely available for: future investments, business exits, real estate sales, etc.
* If ASA grows to $3M by age 65: First $2.5M tax-free, remaining $500K uses your capital gains exemption = $0 tax

### **Why Converting at 12% is Almost Always the Right Move**

The math is stunning. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

**Scenario: \$500,000 in Traditional 401(k), 30 years until retirement, 5% annual growth**

#### **Option 1: Convert to ASA at 12% Today**

* Tax paid now: \$60,000 (12% × $500K)
* ASA balance: \$440,000 (after tax payment)
* Growth over 30 years at 5%: \$440K → \$1,884,000
* Tax on withdrawal at retirement: \$0
* **Total after-tax kept: \$1,884,000 (100% of growth is tax-free)**

#### **Option 2: Keep in Traditional 401(k), Withdraw at Retirement**

* Tax paid now: \$0
* 401(k) balance at retirement: \$2,048,000 (full $500K grows)
* Tax on withdrawal at retirement: 37% (ordinary income, top bracket) = \$758,000
* **Total after-tax kept: \$1,290,000 (63% after taxes)**
* **Lifetime cost of not converting: \$594,000 in extra taxes**

#### **Option 3: Wait 10 Years, Then Try to Convert (After Window Closes)**

* Tax paid during 10-year window: \$0
* 401(k) balance after 10 years: \$629,000
* Remaining balance: \$629,000
* Conversion tax (now at regular capital gains rate, not 12%): \$95,000 (15% of gains)
* ASA balance after conversion: \$534,000
* Growth over next 20 years: \$534K → \$1,367,000
* Tax on withdrawal at retirement: \$0 (but got less time for tax-free growth)
* **Total after-tax kept: \$1,367,000 (66% after taxes)**
* **Lifetime cost of waiting: \$517,000 vs. converting now**

**The takeaway:** Converting at 12% today leaves you approximately **\$500,000+ better off** than either waiting or never converting. This is life-changing money.

### **Why 12% (Not Higher)?**

The 12% rate is deliberately attractive because:

1. **It's far below your withdrawal tax rate** (22-37% depending on income)
2. **Every dollar you don't pay in taxes now compounds forever** — that $60K you don't pay today becomes $250K+ in lost growth by retirement
3. **It incentivizes participation without coercion** — most people will rationally convert because it's such a good deal
4. **It funds the Great Conversion windfall** ($1.2-1.3T over 10 years) without feeling punitive

At 12%, roughly 75-85% of eligible accounts convert, generating massive revenue while leaving savers dramatically better off.

### **The 10-Year Window: Why It Exists**

**Years 1-10:**
* You can convert at 12%, or contribute to legacy accounts
* Employers transition payroll systems
* Financial institutions build conversion tools
* High conversion rates generate Great Conversion revenue

**Year 11+:**
* Legacy accounts freeze to new contributions
* You can no longer add money to old 401(k)s or IRAs
* Existing balances continue under old withdrawal rules (RMDs, ordinary income tax rates)
* You can still convert anytime, but at regular capital gains rates (not 12%), which makes earlier conversion look much better in hindsight

**Why the window closes:** It prevents permanent complexity. After 10 years, you can't hide in legacy accounts. Either you converted (smart move) or you didn't (expensive move), but the system moves forward.

### **What Happens to Those Who Don't Convert?**

If you keep your Traditional 401(k) after year 10:

* **No new contributions** allowed (account is frozen to new money)
* **Existing balance continues under old rules:**
  * Withdraw before age 59½: 10% penalty + ordinary income tax
  * At age 73: Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) kick in
  * All withdrawals taxed as ordinary income (22-37% depending on bracket)
  * No tax-free growth after conversion deadline

* **You can convert anytime**, but post-window conversions are taxed at capital gains rates:
  * If your 401(k) has appreciated from $500K to $700K, the $200K gain is taxed at 15-20% (capital gains)
  * The original $500K contribution is taxed at 12% (treated as if you converted at the transition rate)
  * This makes the original 12% window look like you missed an incredible opportunity

**Example:** If someone waits until year 15 to convert that $500K → $700K account:
* Conversion tax: \$84,000 (12% × original $500K + 15% × $200K gains)
* If they'd converted at year 1: Only \$60,000 tax
* Cost of waiting: \$24,000 + lost tax-free growth

### **Interaction with Lifetime Capital Gains Rules**

Once converted, ASA withdrawals interact with the lifetime capital gains system:

**Before age 60 (withdrawing early):**
* Contributions: Withdraw anytime, tax-free
* Gains: Taxed as capital gains, uses lifetime $1.5M exemption, then 15%/20%/27%/32% rates

**After age 60 (normal retirement):**
* First \$2.5M of total withdrawals: Tax-free
* Gains beyond $2.5M: Uses lifetime exemption, then capital gains rates

**Example with big growth:**

* You convert $500K at 12% (pay $60K)
* ASA balance: $440K
* Grows to $5M by age 65
* At retirement: Withdraw $2.5M tax-free, remaining $2.5M in gains
* Uses your $1.5M lifetime exemption on part of the remaining gains: $1.5M at 0%, then $1M at 15% = $150K tax
* **Total after-tax: $4.85M** (kept approximately 97% after all taxes)

Compare to Traditional 401(k): $5M × 37% tax = $1.85M in taxes, keeps only $3.15M (63%)

### **How the Conversion Actually Works**

1. **Simple interface:** Log into Fidelity/Schwab/Vanguard or contact your plan administrator
2. **Select "convert" and choose amount:** All at once, or gradual conversions
3. **Automatic calculation:** System shows you the 12% tax and asks for confirmation
4. **Tax payment:** Due in the year you convert (can use withholding or estimated taxes)
5. **Funds move:** Pre-tax balance moves to your ASA
6. **Tax-free growth begins:** All future growth in ASA is tax-free

No paperwork. No complexity. Just better math.

### **The Bottom Line on Legacy Accounts**

The conversion offer is so financially compelling that most Americans should convert immediately:

* **Convert now:** 12% tax, then tax-free forever = \$1.88M at retirement
* **Don't convert:** 37% tax on withdrawals = \$1.29M at retirement
* **The difference: $590,000+**

This is why the 10-year window exists — to give people time to understand the offer and act on it. After 10 years, legacy accounts are closed to new money, and the financial case for conversion only gets stronger.

For those who do keep legacy accounts past the window, it's not a catastrophe (your money still grows), but it's an expensive choice relative to the alternative.

## **Q10: What is the Child Tax Credit under this plan, and how is it different from today?**

The Act replaces three overlapping programs with one simple, universal benefit.

### **Today's System: Complex, Hidden, Unequal**

The current system spreads child support across three separate programs, creating confusion and leaving money on the table:

**Child Tax Credit (CTC):**
* Up to \$2,000 per child
* Phases out starting at \$200,000 (single) or \$400,000 (married)
* Only \$1,700 is refundable (meaning lower-income families get less)
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$200B

**Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):**
* Varies wildly: \$600 for no kids, up to \$7,430 for three+ children
* Rewards work but penalizes earning above thresholds
* Requires earned income (excludes caregivers, retirees, disabled)
* 15%+ error rate due to complexity
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$70B

**Child and Dependent Care Credit:**
* 20-35% of childcare costs (max \$2,100 for two+ children)
* Only helps those who itemize
* Requires receipts and provider tax IDs
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$6B

**Total current system: ~\$276B annually**

**The Problem:** This Byzantine structure creates perverse incentives. Families face "benefits cliffs" where earning \$100 more means losing \$500 in benefits. Filing is complicated. Support is unpredictable.

### **The Fair & Simple System: Universal \$6,000 per Child**

* **\$6,000 per child per year** (full benefit for families earning under \$120K)
* **Progressive phase-out** — reduces linearly for incomes \$120K–\$400K, reaches \$0 at \$400K+
* **Fully refundable** — the full amount for those under \$120K
* **No filing required** — automatically delivered via payroll or direct payment

**Phase-out formula:**
- Income ≤ \$120K: Full \$6K per child
- \$120K < Income < \$400K: (Kids × \$6K) × [1 − (Income − \$120K) / \$280K]
- Income ≥ \$400K: \$0

**New system cost: ~\$330B annually**  
**Current system cost: ~\$276B (CTC + EITC + childcare)**  
**Net additional cost: ~\$54B per year**

### **The Complete Picture: How Families Come Out Ahead**

Here's where it gets important: the child benefit alone looks modest compared to what some families receive today. But combine it with **payroll tax rate reduction (12% vs 15.3% for self-employed) and income tax bracket cuts**, and many families get significantly ahead. For families with W-2 wages under the current $160K Social Security wage cap, payroll taxes don't change—but income tax brackets do.

#### **Example 1: Single Parent, 2 Children, \$28,000 Annual Income (W-2 Wages)**

*Note: Benefit phases at \$150K: \$12,000 × [1 − (\$30K / \$280K)] = \$10,714*

### **Why This Works**

The Fair & Simple system accomplishes what current patchwork programs cannot:

1. **Predictability** — families know exactly what they'll receive
2. **Universality** — the same benefit for everyone with children
3. **Alignment with work** — payroll tax elimination means no "benefits cliffs"
4. **Administrative efficiency** — ~\$54B saved by consolidating three programs into one

**The political genius:** This appeals across the aisle. Conservatives like that we're simplifying government, reducing hidden taxes, and cutting fraud. Progressives like that every family with children gets automatic support with no conditions attached.

# Part 3: Closing Loopholes

### **The Core Problem: Complexity Enables Avoidance**

The current tax code is so complex that it has become a system optimized for **non-compliance by design**. When rules are incomprehensible, enforcement becomes impossible. When special rules proliferate, wealthy taxpayers hire specialists to exploit them. And when ordinary Americans can't understand the rules, they lose faith in the system itself.

The result is massive fiscal leakage:

The "tax gap" — the difference between taxes owed and taxes collected — **exceeds \$600 billion annually** according to the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate. [^1] That's not a rounding error. That's half the annual defense budget. That's the entire budget of the Department of Education.

But the tax gap is only part of the story. Beyond non-compliance, there are entire **legal strategies** built into the tax code that allow extreme wealth to avoid taxation indefinitely:

* **Stepped-up basis at death** allows \~\$300 billion in gains to escape taxation every year
* **Buy-borrow-die strategies** let billionaires live off asset-backed loans while never selling appreciated assets, paying zero tax on the economic gain
* **QSBS and carried interest** carve-outs create preferential treatment for specific industries
* **Foundations and dynasty trusts** allow wealth to compound across generations tax-free

These aren't accidents or oversights. They're embedded features of a code so complex that most Americans — and many policymakers — don't even know they exist.

### **Why This Matters**

When the wealthy can permanently avoid taxation while working families pay their full share, it does three things:

1. **Undermines fiscal sustainability** — deficits grow because revenue declines relative to GDP
2. **Corrodes public confidence** — people stop believing the system is fair
3. **Concentrates wealth and power** — dynasties of capital compound without limit or taxation

The Fair & Simple Tax Act addresses this by replacing complex carve-outs with simple, consistent rules that apply equally to everyone.

## **Q11: How does the Act close the 'buy, borrow, die' loophole?**

### **What is 'Buy, Borrow, Die'?**

This is a tax avoidance strategy available exclusively to ultra-wealthy individuals who own highly appreciated assets. Here's how it works today:

**Step 1: Buy an appreciating asset**
You purchase Apple stock for \$100 million when the company is young and undiscovered.

**Step 2: Borrow against it**
Twenty years later, Apple stock is worth \$5 billion. Instead of selling the stock (which would trigger a capital gains tax on your \$4.9 billion profit), you borrow \$500 million using the stock as collateral. You pay interest on the loan, but you've accessed wealth tax-free.

**Step 3: Live off the borrowed money**
You use the \$500 million loan to fund a lavish lifestyle — yachts, jets, real estate, anything. The loan is not income, so you pay no tax on it. You can borrow repeatedly as the asset appreciates, accessing unlimited wealth.

**Step 4: Die with a stepped-up basis**
When you die, the heir inherits the \$5 billion in Apple stock with a 'stepped-up basis' — the IRS resets the cost basis to its value at death. The \$4.9 billion in gains simply **disappear from the tax system**. The heir can immediately sell the stock and owe zero capital gains tax.

**Net result:** You and your heirs extracted \$500 million in economic benefit, funded a lifestyle for decades, and paid zero in capital gains taxes on \$4.9 billion in appreciation. The \$500 million in loans are repaid from the inherited assets after stepping up the basis, often leaving the estate larger than it started.

### **How common is this?**

This strategy is used exclusively by ultra-high-net-worth individuals. It requires:

* Assets worth tens of millions or more
* Ability to borrow substantial amounts against them  
* Estate planning sophistication  
* Access to specialized financial advisors  

It's not a strategy available to the merely wealthy — you need dynastic levels of wealth to make it work. But for those who can use it, it's devastatingly effective.

**Estimates:** Between 10,000 and 50,000 ultra-wealthy households may use buy-borrow-die strategies at any given time, though the practice is heavily concentrated among the top 0.01% of wealth holders. Goldman Sachs estimated in 2021 that the annual federal tax revenue loss from this single strategy exceeds \$50 billion.[^2]

### **Why does it work today?**

Two rules work together to enable this loophole:

1. **Loans are not taxable income** — borrowing money is not treated as income, so there's no tax when you take out a loan (and interest payments are often tax-deductible as well)
2. **Stepped-up basis at death** — when you die, your heirs inherit assets with a basis reset to death-day value, erasing all prior gains from the tax system

Together, these two rules create a bizarre outcome: a billionaire can live entirely off borrowed money for decades (no income tax), access unlimited untaxed wealth (no capital gains tax), and pass that wealth to heirs without ever triggering a tax on the appreciation (no tax at death).

### **How does the Fair & Simple Tax Act fix it?**

The Act closes this loophole by treating asset-backed borrowing differently:

**New Rule: Borrowing Against Appreciated Assets Triggers Tax**

* When you borrow against an appreciated asset (one worth more than you paid for it), the excess value of the loan triggers a deemed sale and taxable gain  
* The tax is calculated on the appreciation only (not the entire asset value)  
* The tax is deferred until the loan is repaid or the asset is sold

**Applied to our Apple example:**

* You own Apple stock with a cost basis of \$100M, currently worth \$5B  
* You borrow \$500M against the stock  
* The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats this as a partial deemed sale  
* You recognize \$400M in capital gains (the amount your stock appreciated above what you borrowed: \$500M loan minus \$100M cost basis)  
* You owe capital gains tax on \$400M in gains using the lifetime exemption and progressive rates (if you've already used your \$1.5M exemption, this is taxed at 15%, 20%, 27%, or 32% depending on your total lifetime gains)  
* Your basis steps up to \$500M (the amount borrowed), so your remaining unrealized gains are only \$4.5B (\$5B current value minus \$500M new basis) — preventing double taxation if you later sell or pass the asset to heirs
* You can still borrow the money, but the tax is owed in the year of borrowing (or can be deferred if the asset is illiquid, with interest accruing)

**Why this works:**

This aligns taxation with economic reality. A billionaire borrowing \$500M against appreciated stock has received an economic benefit — they've accessed and consumed wealth. The fact that they technically haven't 'sold' the asset is a mere formality. The Fair & Simple Tax Act says: if you've extracted economic value through borrowing, you owe tax on the gain you've realized, just as if you had sold and repurchased the asset.

**Stepped-up basis is eliminated:**

The current stepped-up basis rule was created decades ago as an administrative convenience — tracking the original cost basis of assets across decades of ownership was thought to be too burdensome and expensive. So policymakers simply reset the basis at death, making accounting easier.

But this "simplification" became a massive loophole. Today, when billionaires die with \$100+ billion in unrealized gains, those gains simply vanish from the tax system. The wealthy learned to exploit this administrative rule, turning it into a permanent wealth transfer device.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates this loophole by treating death as a realization event, just like selling an asset. When you die, unrealized gains are taxed on your final return using the same lifetime capital gains system. Your heirs inherit a 'clean basis' — the value at death becomes their cost basis. This closes the final loophole: they can't inherit \$5B in stock and immediately sell it tax-free.

### **What about legitimate lending?**

A common question: 'What if I borrow against my home or farm to invest?' or 'What if I take out a regular business loan?'

**The answer:** Regular loans for business or personal use are not affected. The rule applies only to **asset-backed loans where the collateral itself has appreciated above your cost basis and the loan amount exceeds your basis.**

Examples of what is NOT affected:

* A business takes out a \$10M bank loan to expand — no special tax  
* A farmer borrows \$5M against farmland to buy equipment — no special tax  
* A homeowner takes out a mortgage to buy a house — no special tax  
* A young entrepreneur borrows against a growing tech company to fund operations — no special tax (the company likely hasn't appreciated much yet)

**What about borrowing to fund innovation and business growth?**

A critical concern: does this rule discourage borrowing that fuels innovation, business expansion, and economic growth?

**No.** The rule does not apply to borrowing used to fund genuine business expansion, research, operations, or other reinvestment. The distinction is straightforward:

* **A venture capital fund** borrows \$500M against a portfolio company's appreciated equity to make other investments — **no special tax**. The borrowed money is being reinvested, creating jobs and economic activity.
* **A founder** borrows against her startup's equity to fund R&D, payroll, or expansion — **no special tax**. The borrowed money flows back into the business.
* **A private equity firm** borrows against portfolio company value to acquire additional companies or fund operations — **no special tax**. This is core business lending.
* **An entrepreneur** borrows against appreciated real estate to open a second location — **no special tax**. The funds are being reinvested in productive activity.

The rule applies only when borrowed funds are used for **personal consumption** (yachts, jets, luxury real estate, lifestyle expenses) rather than business reinvestment or productive economic activity.

**How is this distinction enforced?**

Lenders already track the stated purpose of loans — it's standard underwriting practice. Financial institutions would report:
1. The collateral asset and its appreciated value
2. The borrower's cost basis
3. The stated purpose of the loan (business investment vs. personal use)

The IRS already has well-established legal doctrines (substance-over-form, sham transaction doctrine) for addressing scenarios where claimed business purposes don't align with actual practice. Someone who borrows 'for consulting' but spends it all on a yacht would face the same scrutiny as someone who claims a vacation home is a 'rental property' but never rents it.

**The result:** Innovation and legitimate capital formation are unaffected — while the buy-borrow-die loophole (extracting \$500M to live on a yacht for 30 years without paying tax on appreciated assets) is closed.

### **Impact**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act means:

* Billionaires can't live tax-free off borrowed money indefinitely  
* Wealth must eventually be taxed or passed to heirs who inherit with a clean basis (and then owe tax if they sell)  
* The step-up in basis loophole is closed  
* Families and small businesses are unaffected

**Bottom line:** Buy-borrow-die was a strategy that turned the tax system upside down, letting ultra-wealthy individuals treat borrowing as a substitute for selling, and stepping up basis as a substitute for paying what was owed. The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats borrowing as an economic event and treats death as a realization event — aligning the tax system with basic fairness.

## **Q12: What happens when someone dies?**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, death is treated as a realization event — unrealized capital gains are taxed on the final return, using the same lifetime capital gains system detailed in FAQ 7. Heirs inherit assets with a 'clean basis' at the value at death.

### **How the lifetime exemption applies at death**

Everyone receives a **\$1.5 million lifetime capital gains exemption** that applies to all long-term gains during life — from home sales, stock sales, business exits, or any other appreciated asset.

**At death, any remaining unused exemption applies first to unrealized gains.** This means:

* If you've used \$500K of your lifetime exemption during life, you have **\$1M remaining** to shield unrealized gains at death
* If you've never sold an appreciated asset during life, your **full \$1.5M exemption** applies to unrealized gains at death
* If you've already used your full \$1.5M exemption, unrealized gains at death are taxed using the progressive capital gains rates (15%/20%/27%/32%)

### **How it works in practice**

**Example 1: Typical Middle-Class Estate**

* You own a home worth \$600K (cost basis \$250K, gain \$350K)
* You have \$200K in retirement accounts (ASA, fully taxed or converted)
* You have \$150K in stock (cost basis \$100K, gain \$50K)
* **Total unrealized gains at death:** \$400K

**Tax owed:**
* Remaining lifetime exemption: \$1.5M (unused during life)
* Unrealized gains: \$400K
* Amount taxed: **\$0** (fully covered by exemption)
* Heirs inherit home and stock at stepped-up basis (\$600K and \$150K respectively)

**Example 2: Comfortable Retirement**

* You sold your home during life and used \$800K of your lifetime exemption
* At death, you own stock worth \$3M (cost basis \$1M, gain \$2M)
* **Remaining lifetime exemption:** \$700K

**Tax owed:**
* First \$700K of gain: **\$0** (covered by remaining exemption)
* Next \$1.3M of gain: taxed at 15% = **\$195K**
* **Total tax on final return:** \$195K
* Heirs inherit stock at stepped-up basis of \$3M (clean slate)

**Example 3: Very Large Estate**

* You used your full \$1.5M lifetime exemption during life (sold businesses, real estate, stocks)
* At death, you own \$100M in appreciated stock (cost basis \$20M, gain \$80M)
* **Remaining lifetime exemption:** \$0 (already used)

**Tax owed:**
* First \$1.5M of gain: 15% = \$225K
* Next \$7M of gain: 20% = \$1.4M
* Next \$40M of gain: 27% = \$10.8M
* Remaining \$31.5M of gain: 32% = \$10.08M
* **Total tax on final return:** \$22.5M (28% effective rate on \$80M in gains)
* Heirs inherit stock at stepped-up basis of \$100M

### **Why this is fair**

This system accomplishes several goals:

1. **Protects typical families:** Most Americans die with far less than \$1.5M in unrealized gains. Their estates owe nothing.

2. **Taxes only large fortunes:** Only estates with very large unrealized gains pay significant tax — and even then, only after using any remaining exemption.

3. **Preserves the lifetime system:** The same exemption and progressive rates apply throughout life and at death. No special rules, no separate estate tax schedules.

4. **Prevents permanent wealth avoidance:** Under current law, billionaires can die with \$100+ billion in unrealized gains and pass that wealth to heirs completely tax-free. The Fair & Simple Tax Act closes this loophole while protecting typical wealth accumulation.

5. **Heirs start fresh:** Heirs inherit assets at their value at death (the 'clean basis'), so they don't owe tax on pre-death appreciation. They only owe tax on gains that occur after they inherit.

### **What about illiquid assets?**

For estates holding illiquid assets (family farms, small businesses, real estate), the Act provides **payment flexibility**:

* Tax can be paid over 15 years at a low interest rate
* No forced asset sales
* Family businesses can continue operating

This ensures that typical family wealth transfers — passing down a farm, a family business, or rental property — are not disrupted.

### **The bottom line**

Death is no longer a magic eraser for unrealized gains. But the system protects typical families completely, provides generous exemptions even for large estates, and preserves intergenerational wealth transfers for productive assets.

**Most families owe nothing. Very large fortunes pay what has long been deferred.**

# Part 4: Common Concerns

## **Q14: Will the changes to SALT hurt families in high-tax states?**

**No.** The Fair & Simple Tax Act recognizes state and local tax burdens in a way that is fair, simple, and broadly shared — without preserving a loophole that primarily benefited the wealthiest households. The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces a broken deduction with a fair, automatic credit — and most middle-class families come out ahead. 

Under current law, the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction is poorly designed:

* Only about **10% of filers benefit**, mostly high earners who itemize  
* The value of the deduction rises with your tax bracket, meaning it is worth far more to a household earning \$500,000 than one earning \$80,000  
* It adds paperwork, complexity, and planning games without meaningfully helping most families

As a result, the old SALT deduction functioned less as broad-based relief and more as a narrow, upside-skewed subsidy.

### **Why recognize state and local taxes at all?**

Americans already pay state and local taxes to fund core public services like schools, infrastructure, and public safety. A fair federal tax system should recognize that burden — **without creating an open-ended loophole that primarily benefits high earners**.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act does this by replacing the old SALT deduction with a simple, automatic credit that applies to everyone.

### **How the new system works**

Instead of a deduction that only helps itemizers, the Act provides an **automatic SALT credit**:

* Available to **all filers**, not just those who itemize  
* Calculated automatically using a blended measure of state and local tax burden  
* **Capped**, so benefits do not grow without limit for very high earners  
* Delivered with no additional paperwork

### **The bigger picture**

For most families — especially those earning under \$400,000 — the combination of:

* Payroll tax elimination (a 7.65% raise)  
* Lower or similar income tax rates  
* Automatic child benefits

far outweighs any change in SALT treatment.

## **Q13: Doesn’t eliminating the primary residence exclusion hurt homeowners?**

**No. The lifetime capital gains exemption protects most home sales — and treats homeowners more fairly over time.**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, each individual receives a **\$1.5 million lifetime capital gains exemption** that applies to *all* long-term gains — including gains from the sale of a primary residence.

For most homeowners, this means their home sale remains completely tax-free.

### **A typical homeowner scenario**

* Bought a home for \$250,000  
* Sold years later for \$650,000  
* Total gain: \$400,000  
* Lifetime exemption used: \$400,000  
* **Tax owed: \$0**

The homeowner still has \$1.1 million of exemption remaining for future gains from investments, additional home sales, or a small business exit.

### **What if I move more than once?**

The lifetime exemption is designed to cover **multiple life events**, not just a single sale. Most households accumulate far less than \$1.5 million in total lifetime housing gains, even after several moves over decades.

This means families can buy a starter home, move for work, upsize as their family grows, and downsize later in life — all without triggering capital gains tax in most cases.

### **Why replace the current exclusion?**

The existing home sale exclusion:

* applies only to homeowners, not renters who build wealth through saving  
* encourages tax-driven housing decisions  
* requires tracking ownership and use tests

By contrast, the lifetime exemption:

* applies equally to homes, stocks, and businesses  
* rewards long-term saving regardless of asset type  
* eliminates special rules and paperwork

### **The broader principle**

Unlike the current system, which privileges housing over other forms of saving, the Fair & Simple Tax Act treats homeownership as **one important way** families build long-term security — not a tax-preferred category that distorts behavior.

**Bottom line:**  
Most home sales remain tax-free. Families who move over time are protected. And the tax code treats homeowners and renters more fairly than it does today.

## **Q14: How does this affect charitable giving and nonprofits?**

**The Fair & Simple Tax Act encourages charitable giving for everyone — not just those who itemize.**

Under the current tax code, the charitable deduction is available primarily to high-income households who itemize. For most Americans, giving to charity provides little or no tax benefit at all.

The Act replaces this system with a **simple, universal charitable credit**.

### **How the new charitable credit works**

* Donations to qualified charitable organizations receive a **30% refundable tax credit**  
* The credit is available to **all filers**, regardless of income or whether they itemize  
* The credit is **capped at 25% of a filer’s total tax liability**  
* Contributions must be made in cash or publicly traded securities and reported electronically by the charity

In practical terms:

* A \$1,000 donation generates a \$300 reduction in taxes owed  
* That benefit is the same whether you earn \$50,000 or \$5 million

  ### **Why replace the deduction with a credit?**

The current deduction system has several flaws:

* It provides **larger subsidies to wealthier donors** (because deductions are worth more in higher tax brackets)  
* Roughly **90% of filers receive no tax benefit** for charitable giving  
* It adds complexity and planning strategies that favor sophisticated taxpayers

By contrast, a flat credit:

* treats every donor equally  
* makes the incentive clear and predictable  
* encourages broader participation in charitable giving

  ### **What about large gifts and philanthropy?**

The Act continues to encourage significant charitable contributions, but with reasonable limits.

Capping the credit at a share of tax liability ensures that charitable giving remains a voluntary act of generosity — not a way to redirect the majority of one’s tax bill toward personally favored causes.

This preserves public funding for shared priorities while still strongly supporting nonprofit organizations.

### **What this means for nonprofits**

* Middle- and lower-income donors are more likely to receive a meaningful incentive to give  
* The donor base broadens beyond a small number of high-income households  
* Giving decisions become less driven by tax planning and more by mission and impact

**Bottom line:**  
The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces an uneven, opaque deduction with a clear, universal incentive that supports charities, respects democratic budgeting, and encourages giving across the income spectrum.

## **Q15: What about student loan interest, energy efficiency credits, and home office deductions?**

**These are eliminated.** We believe consumer incentives should be delivered transparently via direct government programs, not embedded in tax code as hidden subsidies.

### **The Philosophy**

When you put incentives in the tax code, three things happen:

1. **They become invisible.** Voters don't know what government spending is happening; it's buried in return complexity
2. **They're regressive.** High earners benefit more (higher marginal rates, better tax planning access)
3. **They create perverse incentives.** Behavior gets distorted by tax rules rather than by actual policy merit

**Example:** A $2,000 energy efficiency credit is worth $600 to a 30% bracket earner but $800 to a 40% earner — even though the environmental benefit is identical. Why should taxpayer income determine the subsidy for climate action?

By contrast, direct programs make government spending visible and can be designed fairly:

### **Student Loan Interest Deduction (~$7–10B annually)**

**Current system:** $2,500 deduction for student loan interest, phasing out at $80K+ income (married). Regressive; excludes borrowers below the deduction threshold.

**Fair & Simple approach:** Eliminate the deduction. Handle student debt via:
- **Direct income-driven repayment reform** (cap payments at % of discretionary income, with transparent forgiveness timelines)
- **Direct subsidies for specific populations** (teachers, public servants) if we want to incentivize those careers
- **Transparent budget line-item** so voters know what we're spending on debt relief

This way: Everyone can see what we're paying, and repayment is based on actual ability-to-pay, not tax bracket.

### **Energy Efficiency & EV Credits (~$50–80B in various credits annually)**

**Current system:** Fragmented credits for solar, heat pumps, EVs, home efficiency upgrades. Complex eligibility rules, income phase-outs, form-filing. Benefits accrue to higher-income households with access to tax planners and upfront capital.

**Fair & Simple approach:** Eliminate all personal energy credits. Replace with:
- **Point-of-sale rebates** (buyer walks into dealer or contractor, rebate is processed at checkout; no tax filing required)
- **Direct grants for low-income retrofits** (government sends contractor to your home, does work, pays contractor directly)
- **Transparent budget** so Congress debates: "Do we want to spend $60B on climate investment this year?"

**Why this is better:** A homeowner buying a heat pump doesn't need to remember to claim a credit on next year's taxes. They get the savings immediately. Contractors know exact pricing. And voters can see: "We spent $60B on clean energy incentives last year."

### **Home Office Deduction**

**Current system:** "Simplified option" ($5/sq ft, capped at 300 sq ft = max $1,500/year) or "actual expense" method (depreciate home, deduct % of utilities, mortgage interest, property tax, repairs). Confusing; encourages creative allocation of home expenses.

**Fair & Simple approach:** **Home office remains a standard business deduction on Schedule C** — but it's treated like any other business expense:
- If you're self-employed and have a dedicated office space, you can deduct the direct costs of that space (rent if rented, or fair-market rent if in your own home)
- You track square footage and business-use percentage
- No percentage allocation of household utilities or mortgage interest
- It's simple, auditable, and leaves no room for gaming

**The key difference:** You're not trying to apportion your mortgage/utilities/repairs across your home. You're simply deducting the cost of your workspace, same as you'd deduct rent for a commercial office.

**Example:**
- You own a home and use 200 sq ft (10% of your home) as a dedicated office
- Your home's fair-market rent value is $24,000/year (an appraisal figure)
- You can deduct $2,400/year for the office space
- That's it. No depreciation schedules, no utilities allocation, no repairs basis

This remains fully deductible by self-employed people — we're not eliminating it, just simplifying it and removing the loopholes that turned it into a way to allocate personal home expenses.

### **Why This Approach**

These three categories represent ~$60–100B in annual tax expenditures that:

- Are poorly targeted (help higher-income households more)
- Are invisible to voters (buried in code complexity)
- Distort behavior (people make decisions based on tax incentives, not actual economics)
- Are hard to audit and easy to abuse

By moving them to **direct, transparent, auditable programs**, we:

✓ Make government spending visible  
✓ Design benefits fairly (same subsidy for same action, regardless of income/bracket)  
✓ Reduce tax compliance burden (no forms to file, no audit risk)  
✓ Enable Congress to have honest debates: "Should we spend $60B on clean energy?"

**The bottom line:**  
We're not cutting these programs. We're making them honest.

## **Q15a: What about medical expenses? Don't people with high medical costs need help?**

**Yes, they do.** That's why we're replacing the complex itemized medical deduction with a **simple, refundable medical cost credit.**

### **The Problem with Current Law**

Today's medical expense deduction is broken:

1. **Only helps itemizers:** Most people (87%) take the standard deduction and get zero help with medical costs
2. **High threshold:** You can only deduct medical expenses **exceeding 7.5% of your AGI**
   - On $60K income, you need $4,500 in expenses just to start deducting
   - On $100K income, you need $7,500
3. **Regressive:** Higher earners get bigger tax savings (worth more at 37% bracket than 12%)
4. **Complex:** Requires itemizing, tracking receipts, understanding qualified medical expenses

**Result:** A family with a $40K medical emergency gets little or no help because they don't itemize or don't exceed the threshold.

### **The Fair & Simple Solution: Universal Medical Cost Credit**

**Structure:**
- **30% refundable credit** on medical expenses above **$5,000 threshold**
- Available to **everyone** (not just itemizers)
- **Fully refundable** (get the benefit even if you owe no tax)
- Simple to claim (no itemization, just report total qualified medical expenses)

**Example 1: Middle-class family, $70K income, $15K medical emergency**
- **Current system:**
  - Need $5,250 to start deducting (7.5% of $70K)
  - Can deduct: $15K - $5,250 = $9,750
  - Tax savings at 12% bracket: $1,170
  - **But**: Only if they itemize (most don't)
- **Fair & Simple:**
  - Expenses above $5K: $15K - $5K = $10K
  - Credit: $10K × 30% = **$3,000 refundable**
  - No itemization required, get it even if you owe no tax

**Example 2: Low-income family, $35K income, $12K medical costs**
- **Current system:**
  - Need $2,625 to start deducting
  - Can deduct: $12K - $2,625 = $9,375
  - **But**: Take standard deduction anyway (don't itemize), so get $0
- **Fair & Simple:**
  - Expenses above $5K: $12K - $5K = $7K
  - Credit: $7K × 30% = **$2,100 refundable**
  - Get the benefit regardless of itemization or tax owed

### **Why This Is Better**

1. **Universal:** Helps everyone with high medical costs, not just itemizers
2. **Progressive:** Same 30% rate regardless of income bracket (vs. regressive deduction)
3. **Refundable:** Get the benefit even if you owe no tax (helps low-income families most)
4. **Simple:** No itemization, no calculating AGI thresholds, just report expenses
5. **Fair threshold:** $5K is simpler than "7.5% of AGI" and roughly equivalent for median incomes

### **What Qualifies as Medical Expenses?**

Same categories as today:
- Doctor visits, hospital care, surgery
- Prescription medications
- Medical equipment (wheelchairs, hearing aids, etc.)
- Health insurance premiums (if not pre-tax via employer)
- Long-term care expenses
- Mental health and addiction treatment

**Not qualified:**
- Cosmetic procedures (unless medically necessary)
- General health/wellness products
- Over-the-counter medications (unless prescribed)

### **Budget Impact**

**Current medical deduction:** ~$10–15B/year in tax expenditures (mostly to high-income itemizers)

**New medical credit:** ~$12–18B/year (spread more broadly, helps more families)

**Net cost:** ~$3–5B/year additional (but vastly more equitable and effective)

### **The Bottom Line**

Families facing medical emergencies shouldn't have to navigate itemization rules and AGI thresholds to get help. The medical cost credit delivers relief simply, fairly, and universally—consistent with our philosophy that support should be transparent and accessible to everyone.

## **Q17: Will this punish entrepreneurs and innovators?**

**No. The Fair & Simple Tax Act is designed to reward long-term innovation, protect the startup ecosystem, and eliminate loopholes that distort incentives.**

America’s greatest economic advantage is its ability to turn risky ideas into world-changing companies. This Act is built around that reality — and around the fact that innovation thrives in systems that are predictable, neutral, and fair.

### **Why this strengthens, rather than weakens, innovation**

**1\. The United States remains the best place in the world to build a company.**  
The Act preserves low taxes on long-term investment, a generous lifetime capital gains exemption, and clear, predictable rules. For the vast majority of founders, effective tax rates on exits are **lower than or comparable to current law**, without relying on fragile carve-outs.

The goal is not to penalize success — it is to remove uncertainty so founders can focus on building, not tax planning.

**2\. Patient, high-risk capital is still favored.**  
Founders and early investors who hold equity for the long term continue to benefit from capital gains treatment and the lifetime exemption. Short-term trading is taxed as income; long-term company building is rewarded.

This reinforces the same time horizons that venture capital already depends on.

**3\. The QSBS loophole is replaced with something better, not nothing.**  
QSBS helped some founders, but it was narrow, complex, and arbitrarily structured. Many legitimate startups and investors never qualified.

The Act replaces QSBS with a **simple, universal rule** that applies to all companies and all founders, regardless of industry, structure, or legal form.

That is a win for innovation, not a loss.

### **What about QSBS?**

Let's be direct: QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) is a valuable benefit for some founders today, and yes, **some successful exits will pay more tax under the Fair & Simple Tax Act**. But it's worth understanding what QSBS actually does — and who it leaves behind.

**What QSBS provides today:**

* **100% exclusion** on capital gains from selling qualified small business stock
* Capped at the greater of **\$10 million** or **10x your original investment**
* Requires: C-corporation structure, held 5+ years, under \$50M in assets at issuance, active business (not passive holding company)

**Who QSBS excludes:**

* **LLCs, S-corps, and partnerships** — even if they're building innovative companies
* **Restaurants, hotels, farms** — specifically excluded industries
* **Professional services** — law, accounting, consulting, medicine
* **Financial services and real estate** — also excluded
* **Second and third companies** — founders who build multiple businesses face complexity and gaming around stacking \$10M exemptions

**A concrete comparison: \$20M founder exit**

Let's take a founder who starts with \$100K in stock and exits at \$20M after 7 years (a successful outcome, but not a mega-exit).

**Today with QSBS:**
* First \$10M of gain: **\$0 tax** (100% excluded)
* Remaining \$10M of gain: ~20% federal capital gains = **\$2M tax**
* **Total tax: \$2M**
* **Founder keeps: \$18M (90%)**

**Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act:**
* Lifetime exemption: \$1.5M → **\$0 tax**
* Next \$7M of gain: 15% = **\$1.05M**
* Next \$11.5M of gain: 20% = **\$2.3M**
* **Total tax: \$3.35M**
* **Founder keeps: \$16.65M (83%)**

**The honest answer:** Yes, that's **\$1.35M more in tax**. But the founder still keeps **\$16.65 million** — enough to be financially secure for life, start another company, or invest in the next generation of founders.

**Why the universal system is better:**

1. **It applies to everyone.** The LLC founder building a restaurant tech company gets the same \$1.5M exemption as the C-corp SaaS founder. The real estate entrepreneur gets the same treatment as the biotech founder. No arbitrary industry exclusions.

2. **It's predictable and simple.** You don't need specialized tax counsel to figure out if you qualify. You don't need to structure your company a certain way just for QSBS. You don't need to game the system with multiple entities.

3. **It rewards all innovation, not just venture-backed C-corps.** The fastest-growing segment of American entrepreneurship is outside traditional VC channels. Why should a founder building a \$50M service business in an 'excluded' industry get zero benefit while a comparable SaaS founder gets \$10M tax-free?

4. **It scales progressively.** QSBS has a hard cliff at \$10M (or 10x basis). Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, rates rise gradually as lifetime gains increase — no sudden jumps, no gaming around the cap.

5. **It eliminates wealth transfer games.** Today, sophisticated founders structure QSBS to pass gains to family members, use multiple entities, or time transactions around the cap. The lifetime exemption system eliminates this complexity.

**The bottom line on QSBS:**

If you're a founder building the next billion-dollar company, you're going to be extraordinarily wealthy under either system. The question is whether we build a tax code around **fragile, gameable carve-outs that only help some founders** — or a **simple, universal system that treats all innovation equally**.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act chooses the latter. Most founders — especially those outside traditional tech — come out ahead. And yes, some mega-exits pay modestly more. But in exchange, we get a system that's fair, predictable, and built to last.

**4\. Extreme outcomes are treated differently — deliberately.**  
The Act asks more only when lifetime gains reach levels that are extraordinarily rare and highly concentrated. These adjustments are modest, predictable, and well below top labor income rates.

This reflects a basic principle: America should reward extraordinary success, but not build a tax code that depends on it being completely untaxed.

**5\. Innovation depends on systems, not carve-outs.**  
Breakthroughs happen in ecosystems — universities, infrastructure, talent pipelines, and deep capital markets. A simpler, more durable tax system strengthens those foundations, which matter more to long-term innovation than any single exemption.

**Bottom line:**  
The Fair & Simple Tax Act protects ambition, rewards risk-taking, and preserves America’s innovation edge — while ensuring that the system works for decades rather than depending on fragile loopholes.

## **Q18: How does this close estate planning loopholes like GRATs, dynasty trusts, and valuation discounts?**

**The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates the underlying conditions that make sophisticated estate planning techniques work — without having to ban each one individually.**

For ultra-wealthy families, the current tax code isn't just complex — it's a toolkit for transferring billions across generations with minimal taxation. Most Americans have never heard of these strategies. But for families worth \$50 million or more, they're standard practice.

### **What are these techniques?**

Let's look at four major strategies — what they were originally designed to do, and how they became loopholes.

#### **1\. GRATs (Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts)**

**Original purpose:** Help families transfer a business to the next generation while the founder retains income during retirement.

**How it became a loophole:**
* You transfer \$100M in stock to a GRAT
* The GRAT pays you back exactly \$100M over 2 years (the IRS "hurdle rate")
* If the stock appreciates above the hurdle rate (say, to \$130M), your heirs get the \$30M gain **completely tax-free**
* If the stock goes down, the GRAT collapses and you're back where you started — **no penalty**

**Result:** It's a **zero-risk bet**. Billionaires run serial 2-year GRATs continuously, transferring hundreds of millions in appreciation with zero gift tax. The Walton family (Walmart) has reportedly used GRATs to transfer over \$100 billion to heirs.

#### **2\. Dynasty Trusts**

**Original purpose:** The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (1986) was meant to prevent wealthy families from skipping ONE generation to avoid estate tax twice.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Several states (South Dakota, Delaware, Nevada) abolished the "Rule Against Perpetuities" — the old common law rule that said trusts must eventually end
* Now trusts can last **500+ years**
* Wealth compounds tax-free across **10+ generations**
* Each generation gets distributions but never owns the assets, so **no estate tax is ever triggered**

**Result:** Families can place \$50M in a dynasty trust today, let it compound for 200 years, and transfer \$50+ billion to great-great-great-grandchildren without ever touching the estate tax system again.

#### **3\. Valuation Discounts (Family Limited Partnerships)**

**Original purpose:** A minority stake in a private business with no control or liquidity IS legitimately worth less than its proportional share.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Transfer \$100M in assets (stocks, real estate, whatever) to a Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
* Gift "minority interests" to your children
* Claim **30-40% valuation discounts** because the stakes have "no control" and "no liquidity"
* Even though the family collectively controls everything and can dissolve the FLP whenever they want

**Result:** Turn a \$100M taxable gift into a \$60-70M gift for tax purposes — saving \$12-16M in gift taxes. The IRS calls it a sham. Wealthy families do it anyway and fight the audits.

#### **4\. Private Foundations**

**Original purpose:** Encourage philanthropy by letting wealthy donors stay involved in charitable work.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Transfer \$500M in appreciated stock to a private foundation (no capital gains tax on the transfer)
* Family members get paid \$200K-500K salaries as "foundation managers"
* Assets grow tax-free forever
* Only **5% annual distribution required** — foundation can keep 95% of gains each year
* Family controls the foundation (and the capital) **in perpetuity**

**Result:** It's more wealth management vehicle than charity. The family avoids capital gains tax, gets paid to run it, controls where the money goes, and passes control to heirs — all while claiming to be "giving it away."

### **Why traditional reform doesn't work**

Congress has tried to patch these techniques individually — tightening GRAT rules here, limiting valuation discounts there. But:

1. **Tax lawyers innovate faster** — new techniques appear as soon as old ones are banned
2. **Complexity increases** — each patch adds more rules, more exceptions, more ways to game the system
3. **Wealthy families can always afford to fight** — \$500K in legal fees is nothing if you're saving \$50M in estate tax

The Fair & Simple Tax Act takes a different approach: **remove the foundation these techniques depend on**.

### **What do these loopholes cost?**

The magnitude of annual revenue loss from sophisticated estate planning is staggering:

| Technique | Estimated Annual Revenue Loss | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **GRATs** | \$15-25 billion | Mostly used by ultra-high-net-worth (billionaire tier) |
| **Dynasty Trusts** | \$20-40 billion | Deferred taxation across generations; concentrated in ultra-wealthy |
| **Valuation Discounts** | \$10-15 billion | Annual gift/estate tax reduction from overvalued discounts |
| **Private Foundations** | \$5-10 billion | Annual deferred capital gains + tax-favored accumulation |
| **Stepped-up Basis (all techniques)** | \$40-80 billion | The biggest single loophole: all gains erased at death |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUE LOSS** | **\$90-170 billion** | Concentrated among top 0.1% of wealth holders |

**Sources & Notes:**
* These estimates are derived from IRS studies, Treasury analyses, and academic research on estate planning behavior
* The stepped-up basis figure represents roughly **\$2-3 trillion in unrealized gains** that escape taxation annually (valued at 2-5% effective tax rate)
* Most of this benefit flows to fewer than 50,000 families (top 0.01% of wealth distribution)
* These are **conservative estimates** — actual losses may be higher, as sophisticated planning is deliberately obscured

**By comparison:**
* This \$90-170B annual loss exceeds the entire annual budget of the Department of Education (\$238B includes K-12 + higher ed, but the pure DOE discretionary budget is \$80B)
* It's equivalent to eliminating all federal spending on infrastructure, research, and development programs
* It represents roughly **2-4% of total federal revenue**, concentrated in avoidance by the ultra-wealthy

### **What would the Act recover?**

Closing these loopholes would recover **\$75-150 billion annually** in the long run, though the transition is complex:

**Years 1-5 (during Great Conversion):** \$50-75 billion/year (lower during transition)

**Years 6+:** \$100-150 billion/year (full effect as:
* First generation of estates taxed on unrealized gains at death
* Dynasty trusts can no longer defer indefinitely
* GRATs lose their zero-risk structure
* Stepped-up basis eliminated

**This revenue:**
* Is **NOT** raised by punishing typical families (who remain completely protected)
* Comes from **closing permanent tax avoidance** used exclusively by the ultra-wealthy
* Represents recovery of **revenue that has long been deferred or lost**

### **Why this matters**

The U.S. federal government is currently running a structural deficit, with revenues roughly \$1-2 trillion below spending levels. Recovering \$100+ billion annually from wealthy families using sophisticated estate planning techniques is both:

1. **Fiscally necessary** — helps restore revenue-to-spending balance
2. **Foundationally fair** — closes techniques that are available to maybe 50,000 families globally

Without closing these loopholes, the tax burden continues to shift to the working and middle classes — who can't afford specialized tax planning and must pay their full share.

### **How the Act closes these loopholes automatically**

The Act doesn't ban GRATs or dynasty trusts or valuation discounts. Instead, it **eliminates the underlying conditions that make them work**:

#### **Death as a realization event**
* Under current law, you can hold appreciated assets your entire life and pass them to heirs with no capital gains tax ever (thanks to stepped-up basis)
* Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, **death triggers capital gains tax** using the lifetime exemption system
* GRATs, dynasty trusts, and foundations can't avoid taxation indefinitely — someone eventually pays tax on the appreciation

#### **No stepped-up basis**
* Current law lets heirs inherit assets at death-day value, erasing all prior gains
* The Act eliminates this — heirs inherit at your cost basis
* This means trusts can't accumulate gains for decades and reset the basis at each generation

#### **Lower estate tax exemption**
* Current law: \$14M per person (\$28M per couple)
* The Act: \$5M per person (\$10M per couple), with progressive rates above that
* Harder to shelter large fortunes completely from estate tax

#### **Progressive capital gains rates**
* You can't avoid tax indefinitely by never selling
* Gains eventually face 15%/20%/27%/32% rates depending on lifetime accumulation
* High-net-worth estates pay tax on unrealized gains at death

#### **The \$1.5M lifetime exemption**
* Protects typical families completely
* Shelters the first \$1.5M in lifetime gains
* Wealthy families already used their exemption long ago — dynasty trusts can't reset it

### **What this means in practice**

**For GRATs:** You can still use them, but when you die (or when the trust beneficiaries eventually realize the gains), the appreciation is taxed. No more permanent tax-free wealth transfer.

**For Dynasty Trusts:** The trust can still exist for 500 years, but each generation pays tax on distributions or sales. The compounding wealth doesn't escape taxation forever.

**For Valuation Discounts:** Even if you claim a discount for gift tax purposes, the beneficiaries inherit your original cost basis — so when they sell (or when they die), the full appreciation is taxed. The discount just delayed tax, it didn't eliminate it.

**For Private Foundations:** You still avoid capital gains on the transfer, but you already gave the asset away — your heirs don't inherit it. And the foundation must distribute 5% annually or face penalties. The Act doesn't change this much, except to eliminate the ability to use foundations as a step in dynasty wealth transfer.

### **What about legitimate family businesses?**

A common concern: "What if I've spent 40 years building a \$20M business and want to pass it to my children?"

The Fair & Simple Tax Act protects this:

* **\$1.5M lifetime exemption per person** (\$3M for a couple) shields the first layer of gains
* **15-year payment flexibility** for illiquid assets — no forced sales
* **Heirs inherit at stepped-up basis** (value at death), so they only pay tax on future gains
* **Progressive rates** — a \$20M family business with \$15M in gains pays modest rates (15-20%), not confiscatory rates

The difference: **a genuine family business transition is protected. A \$5 billion dynasty trust using legal engineering to skip 5 generations of estate tax is not.**

### **Why this approach works better**

Instead of playing whack-a-mole with individual techniques, the Act removes the game board:

* **No stepped-up basis** → can't erase gains by dying
* **Death as realization** → can't defer forever
* **Progressive rates on lifetime gains** → can't avoid tax by never selling
* **Lower estate exemption** → can't shelter \$50M+ completely

**The result:** Ultra-wealthy families can still use trusts, foundations, and sophisticated planning. But they can't use them to **permanently avoid taxation on billions in gains**.

### **The bottom line**

These estate planning techniques started with legitimate purposes — helping families transition businesses, encouraging philanthropy, recognizing illiquid asset challenges. But they became loopholes because the tax code let you defer gains indefinitely and reset basis at death.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act doesn't ban these techniques. It just says: **at some point, someone pays tax on the appreciation**. That's not radical. It's basic fairness.

Typical families are completely protected. Ultra-wealthy families can still transfer wealth — they just can't transfer billions tax-free across 10 generations using legal engineering.

## **Q19: What about expatriation and capital flight?**

**The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats renunciation of citizenship the same way it treats death — as a realization event. Departing citizens owe tax on accumulated gains, just like they would if they sold everything.**

This is a legitimate concern. History shows that aggressive taxation of wealth can trigger capital flight — wealthy individuals leave countries, move assets offshore, or restructure to minimize exposure. The most famous case is France's wealth tax, which drove roughly 42,000 millionaires to leave between 2000-2012, costing an estimated \$7+ billion in annual tax revenue (and ultimately the tax was repealed in 2017).

But the Fair & Simple Tax Act's structure is fundamentally different — and far better positioned to handle this risk.

### **Why capital flight is a bigger risk for wealth taxes**

A pure wealth tax is **almost impossible to enforce**:

* **Annual valuations** of illiquid assets (private companies, real estate, art) — subjective and contentious
* **Easy to hide** — move assets offshore, create shell companies, use trusts to obscure ownership
* **Low compliance cost to evade** — relative to tax owed, it's economical to spend \$500K in planning to avoid \$10M/year in wealth tax
* **Creates perverse incentives** — incentivizes people to leave, and those who stay are the ones paying

This is why France, Sweden, Austria, and other countries abandoned wealth taxes: the revenue loss from flight exceeded the revenue from those who stayed.

### **Why the Fair & Simple Tax Act is different**

The Act only taxes:
1. **Realized gains** — when an asset is actually sold (hard to hide; creates documented transaction)
2. **Unrealized gains at death** — when a person dies (hard to evade permanently)
3. **Unrealized gains at departure** — when a citizen renounces citizenship (the new frontier)

This is fundamentally harder to evade because:

* **Realization events are visible** — assets must be sold to access the wealth; sales create paper trails
* **Most valuable assets are tracked** — publicly traded securities, real estate with titles, cryptocurrency on major exchanges
* **Proceeds are hard to hide** — once assets are sold, the cash must go somewhere; large bank deposits trigger reporting

### **How expatriation works under the Act**

When a U.S. citizen renounces citizenship or loses citizenship, they owe tax as if they sold all appreciated assets on the date of departure:

**The calculation:**
* All appreciated assets (stocks, real estate, businesses, cryptocurrency) are marked to market on departure date
* The individual applies their remaining lifetime capital gains exemption (same as at death)
* Gains above the exemption are taxed at the progressive rates (15%/20%/27%/32% depending on total lifetime gains)
* Illiquid assets receive 15-year payment flexibility (same as at death) — no forced fire sales

**Example: Founder departing after successful exit**

* Founder already used \$2M of exemption during life (through earlier stock sales)
* Has \$500M in unrealized gains in a private company at departure
* Remaining exemption: \$0 (exceeded $1.5M cap)

**Tax owed:**
* First \$1.5M: 15% = \$225K
* Next \$7M: 20% = \$1.4M
* Next \$40M: 27% = \$10.8M
* Remaining \$451.5M: 32% = \$144.5M
* **Total tax: ~\$157M** (31% effective rate on \$500M)
* Founder keeps: ~\$343M (69%)

This is substantial but:
- Founder is still extraordinarily wealthy
- No forced asset sale (15-year payment flexibility)
- Comparable to what they'd owe if they stayed and sold the company anyway

### **Why this is hard to evade**

**On untrackable assets (crypto, offshore accounts):**

Evasion is theoretically possible but practically risky:

* **Proceeds still need to go somewhere:** Once assets are sold and cash is obtained, it cannot be kept under a mattress indefinitely. Bank deposits, real estate purchases, business investments — all leave trails.

* **FATCA and FBAR already exist:** U.S. citizens abroad must report foreign bank accounts and financial assets. Failure to report is criminal. Hiding a \$500M account offshore without disclosure is not feasible.

* **Repatriation is the real leverage:** If an individual wants to spend the money in a developed country (or bring it back to the U.S.), it gets flagged. Moving to Singapore and living on \$10M/year is possible, but moving \$500M in proceeds requires bank transfers and disclosure.

* **Beneficial ownership reporting is expanding:** Recent rules require disclosure of true beneficial owners of accounts and entities. It's getting harder to hide behind shell companies.

* **Timing problem:** Renunciation must occur *now*, but individuals may wish to spend proceeds *later*. That gap is where evasion risk lives. Some people will hide some proceeds. But the scale is limited.

### **What's the realistic escape rate?**

Based on expatriation trends and comparable situations:

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Annual U.S. expatriations** | 2,000-4,000 | Roughly consistent over past decade |
| **Wealth-related expatriations** | 200-500 | Estimate: 10-25% tax-motivated |
| **Successful tax evasion** | 50-150 | Maybe 25-50% of those actually hide proceeds long-term |
| **Annual revenue loss to evasion** | \$2-5 billion | On top of taxes collected from departing wealthy |

**By comparison:**
* The Act recovers \$100+ billion annually from closing estate planning loopholes
* Even if 5% is lost to expatriation evasion, the net position is still \$95+ billion/year positive
* This is radically different from wealth tax countries, where evasion rates hit 30-50%

### **Why departing citizens aren't the primary target anyway**

The biggest wealth is held by the following demographics:

1. **Retirees** — unlikely to leave; want to stay near family, healthcare, legal system
2. **Business owners** — mostly need U.S. market access; can't easily relocate operations
3. **Inheritors** — benefit from stable U.S. legal system and financial markets
4. **Institutional wealth** — universities, foundations, corporate wealth — can't leave

The people most likely to depart are:

* **Highly mobile tech/finance people** — maybe 500-1,000/year
* **Foreign nationals who became U.S. citizens** — some will return home
* **Very wealthy with diverse global interests** — maybe 100-200/year who actively evade

It's real, but it's not the mass exodus that happened with France's wealth tax.

### **Additional enforcement mechanisms**

The Act includes several provisions to minimize evasion:

**Departure bonds:** Consider requiring high-net-worth individuals to post a bond equal to estimated tax on unrealized gains before departure. Can be released once tax is paid.

**Covered expatriate rules:** Expand existing IRC 877A to coordinate with the new realization-on-departure rule. Ensure that returns to the U.S. within 10 years trigger collection.

**Treaty coordination:** Bilateral tax treaties can require information sharing so former U.S. citizens can't hide proceeds in countries with weak reporting standards.

**Deemed sales for certain assets:** For founders/entrepreneurs, consider making departure a "trigger" for certain tax planning strategies (like the QSBS loophole becoming enforceable against proceeds held offshore).

### **The bottom line**

Yes, some high-net-worth individuals will attempt to evade taxes by departing and hiding proceeds offshore. This is a real problem, and enforcement mechanisms should be in place.

But it's **not** a show-stopper like it was for wealth taxes. Here's why:

1. **Only realizations and departures are taxed** — not annual valuations. Much harder to hide permanently.
2. **Most valuable assets are visible** — stocks, real estate, businesses, cryptocurrency on major exchanges.
3. **Proceeds are hard to hide forever** — they eventually need to go into banks, investments, or consumption.
4. **Existing reporting rules (FATCA, FBAR) already create infrastructure** — you're adding to an existing system, not building from scratch.
5. **The alternative is worse** — without closing these loopholes, the tax burden shifts entirely to the middle class, which is unsustainable and unfair.

Some people will leave and successfully hide proceeds. Estimate: \$2-5B/year in evasion. That's real money, but it's 2-5% of what the Act recovers from closing loopholes. The net gain is still massive.

A robust tax system isn't one where nobody evades — it's one where the rate of evasion is manageable and the benefit of closure outweighs the cost of enforcement. The Fair & Simple Tax Act meets that standard.



**The Fair & Simple Tax Act preserves 1031 exchanges — one of the few carve-outs in the system. But with critical limits: you can defer gains only if you reinvest proceeds into real property, and you must reinvest within a defined window. No infinite deferral chains. Depreciation deductions continue for landlords, protecting cash flow for middle-class rental property owners.**

Real estate is fundamentally different from other assets. Housing and commercial property are essential infrastructure, not speculative investments. They generate economic activity, provide shelter, and create stable wealth for millions of middle-class Americans. That's why 1031 exchanges (allowing deferral of capital gains when you reinvest proceeds into like-kind real property) make sense to preserve.

But current 1031 practice has become a wealth deferral machine for sophisticated investors. The loophole costs **\$35-50 billion annually** in deferred taxes. The Act reforms 1031 while maintaining its core purpose.

### **The current 1031 loophole**

A 1031 exchange allows a taxpayer to sell real property and reinvest proceeds into "like-kind" replacement property without triggering capital gains tax. It's theoretically temporary deferral — you eventually owe tax when you exit real estate entirely. In practice, it becomes indefinite deferral through careful structuring:

**The infinite deferral chain:**

| Year | Event | Basis | Gain | Tax Owed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2000 | Buy strip mall | \$1M | — | \$0 |
| 2010 | Sell for \$5M, buy new property (1031) | \$1M | \$4M | \$0 (deferred) |
| 2020 | Sell for \$15M, buy new property (1031) | \$5M | \$10M | \$0 (deferred) |
| 2025 | Owner dies | \$15M | \$14M | \$0 (stepped-up basis, no tax) |
| | | | **Cumulative gain:** \$24M | **Tax paid: \$0** |

This isn't deferral — it's permanent evasion. An investor can compound wealth indefinitely, swapping properties and never paying tax, until death (when stepped-up basis eliminates the entire tax bill).

Compare this to any other asset class:

* **Founder sells a startup:** Capital gains tax is due immediately
* **Investor sells a stock portfolio:** Capital gains tax is due immediately
* **Business owner sells their company:** Capital gains tax is due immediately

Real estate alone gets a loophole that allows permanent tax-free wealth accumulation.

### **How the Act reforms 1031**

**Key changes:**

1. **1031 exchanges still allowed** — Real estate reinvestment deferrals are permitted (consistent with housing-as-essential-infrastructure rationale)

2. **But with reinvestment requirement:** You can defer only if you reinvest proceeds into real property within 180 days (streamlined from current complex 45-day rules). Half-sale/half-deferral positions are not allowed.

3. **Basis increases by non-reinvested proceeds:** If you sell for \$5M and reinvest only \$3M, your new basis is \$3M (not \$1M from the original property). The non-reinvested \$2M is taxable immediately. This prevents "cherry-picking" gains.

4. **Tax is due at death or final exit:** When you eventually exit real estate (die, sell to a non-1031 replacement, move abroad), all deferred gains are taxable at that time. The deferral chain stops at death.

5. **Stepped-up basis is eliminated:** Heirs inherit at stepped-up value (no tax at death), but if they sell or borrow, they pay tax based on stepped-up value, not original basis.

**Depreciation deductions continue:** This is crucial. Landlords still deduct depreciation against rental income (protecting cash flow). But when property is sold or inherited, depreciation recapture occurs at 25% (current law), or it's added to unrealized gains subject to the capital gains tax at death.

### **Examples: How this works**


**Example 1: Mom-and-Pop Landlord (Protected)**

**Situation:**
* Tom and Lisa own two rental properties worth \$2M total
* Original basis: \$800K
* Unrealized gains: \$1.2M
* Over 15 years, they've deducted \$400K in depreciation
* Both are W-2 employees; rental income puts them in 25% bracket

**At retirement (age 65):**
* They sell both properties for \$2.2M (small gain from current \$2M value)
* Realized gain: \$1.4M (\$2.2M sale price \- \$800K original basis)
* Lifetime exemption already used: \$0 (they haven't had major capital events)
* Remaining exemption: \$1.5M (each; \$3M couple)
* Tax owed: \$0 (entire gain covered by exemption)
* Depreciation recapture: \$400K at 25% = \$100K
* **Total tax:** \$100K on \$2.2M sale (4.5% effective rate)
* **After-tax proceeds:** \$2.1M

**Why they're protected:**
* Primary exemption covers unrealized gains
* Depreciation recapture at 25% (same as today)
* Cash flow from depreciation deductions let them build equity over 15 years

**Example 2: Real Estate Syndicator (Taxed)**

**Situation:**
* Susan manages a real estate fund with \$500M in diversified property holdings
* Original combined basis: \$100M
* Current unrealized gains: \$400M
* She's been reinvesting sales into new properties via 1031 for 20 years
* Total deferred gains in portfolio: ~\$320M

**Under current law:**
* As long as she 1031s into new properties, gains defer indefinitely
* At death, stepped-up basis eliminates \$320M+ in gains
* Estate pays zero tax on accumulated gains

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

**Scenario A: She continues to reinvest in real estate**
* Each sale triggers new 1031 election
* Gains defer until she exits real estate OR dies
* At death: All deferred gains become taxable
* Portfolio gains \$400M: First \$1.5M at 15%, then 20%/27%/32%
* Tax owed: ~\$128M
* Heirs inherit at stepped-up basis (clean going forward)

**Scenario B: She decides to diversify and sell**
* Sells \$500M property portfolio
* Doesn't reinvest in 1031 (exits real estate)
* Immediate tax: ~\$128M (same calculation as above)
* After-tax proceeds: \$372M (to deploy elsewhere)

**Why this matters:**
* Deferred gains don't vanish; they're collected at exit or death
* Syndicators can no longer chain 1031s indefinitely
* Incentivizes eventual realization and economic activity

**Example 3: Mixed situation — Partial 1031**

**Situation:**
* Marcus sells a commercial property for \$10M (basis \$2M, gain \$8M)
* Reinvests \$7M into new property under 1031
* Keeps \$3M in cash for renovations/acquisitions

**Tax treatment:**
* Gain on property: \$8M
* Deferred portion: \$7M ÷ \$10M sales price = 70% of gain = \$5.6M deferred
* Taxable portion: 30% of gain = \$2.4M
* Applied to lifetime exemption: \$1.5M covered, \$900K taxed
* If in 20% bracket: \$180K tax owed now
* New basis on \$7M reinvested property: \$7M (not original \$2M)

**Why this prevents gaming:**
* Can't use partial 1031 to reinvest selectively and defer all gains
* Non-reinvested proceeds trigger proportional tax
* Basis resets to prevent double deferral

### **Why preserve 1031 for real estate only?**

This is a critical distinction. Some might ask: "If 1031 is so valuable, why not extend it to startups, acquisitions, and other liquidation events?"

**Answer: Consistency and clarity.**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates special carve-outs. Everyone pays tax on realized gains when they sell an asset — founders, PE investors, real estate syndicators. No special rules for asset class.

**Why real estate is the exception:**

1. **Housing is essential infrastructure** — Unlike tech stocks or private equity interests, real property provides shelter, employs workers, generates local tax revenue. Preserving the incentive to maintain/improve real estate is a legitimate policy goal.

2. **Limited deferral** — The 180-day reinvestment window prevents indefinite chaining. Bases reset. Exit is inevitable (death, diversification, final sale). This isn't permanent tax avoidance; it's time-limited deferral.

3. **Precedent and stability** — 1031 exchanges date to 1921. Millions of small landlords depend on this. Eliminating it would destabilize real estate markets. Preserving it with reforms is practical.

4. **Contrast with founders** — Why don't founders get deferral if they reinvest in a new startup? Because:
   - Startups aren't essential infrastructure
   - Founder mobility is high (can move to any country; real estate can't move)
   - Deferral for founders creates massive gaming opportunities (pseudo-sales, secondary market evasion)
   - The goal is to encourage capital deployment, which already happens without tax incentives in tech (talent, optionality, wealth potential)

### **Impact on middle-class real estate investors**

The average rental property owner is protected by a combination of factors:

1. **Lifetime exemption covers most small sales** — A couple with two rental properties worth \$2-3M total will cover most/all of their gain in the \$3M joint exemption.

2. **Depreciation deductions create tax-free cash flow** — Building equity through deductions, then inheriting stepped-up basis, has enabled millions to build wealth. That mechanism is preserved.

3. **1031 deferrals for reinvestment** — Those who stay in real estate can continue 1031 exchanges (though with basis resets and eventual taxation at exit).

4. **Illiquid asset payment flexibility** — If someone dies with illiquid real estate, heirs have 15 years to pay capital gains tax. Doesn't force fire sales.

**The real impact:** Aggressive real estate syndication and infinite-deferral strategies are taxed. Middle-class ownership is protected.

### **Depreciation: Deductions continue, recapture at sale/death**

**Why keep depreciation deductions?**

Depreciation is a real economic cost (buildings deteriorate, require maintenance). Allowing the deduction incentivizes property maintenance and reinvestment in upkeep. Eliminate it, and landlords have less cash flow for repairs and improvements.

**How it works:**

| Scenario | Treatment |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Own rental property, take depreciation deductions** | Continue (same as current law). \$50K/year deduction against rental income. |
| **Sell property (1031 or otherwise)** | Recapture at 25% (current law). \$400K accumulated depreciation = \$100K tax. |
| **Inherit property** | Inherit at stepped-up value; depreciation "resets" to new basis. Old depreciation is not recaptured at death. |
| **Borrow against property** | Deemed sale rule applies. If you borrow more than basis, gain above basis triggers tax (same as buy-borrow-die rule). |

**Cost Segregation (aggressive depreciation strategies):**

High-net-worth real estate investors often use "cost segregation" studies to accelerate depreciation and create large upfront tax deductions. This can be legitimate (certain components like parking lots genuinely depreciate faster) or aggressive (claiming 40-year buildings depreciate like 5-year equipment).

The Act doesn't eliminate cost segregation but coordinates it with the realization-at-death rule. Aggressive strategies don't disappear; they're collected at death when the property is deemed sold.

### **The fairness argument**

Real estate gets special treatment (1031 deferrals) that other assets don't. Why is this defensible?

**Two reasons:**

1. **Essential infrastructure:** Real property generates housing, jobs, commercial activity. Unlike stock portfolios or private equity interests, real estate is tied to specific locations and communities. Tax policy can legitimately favor investment in infrastructure.

2. **Consistency prevents gaming:** By limiting 1031 to real property only, we avoid a cascade of special rules. "Can founders reinvest in new startups tax-free?" "Can PE investors reinvest in new funds?" Each question creates lobbying and complexity. Drawing a bright line around real property is cleaner.

### **Revenue impact**

Reforming 1031 (requiring reinvestment, basis resets, eventual taxation at death/exit) captures:

* **Immediate realization:** \$10-15B/year (from non-reinvested proceeds and partial 1031s)
* **Deferred realization at death:** \$20-30B/year (over next 20 years, as deferred gains finally get taxed)
* **Total present-value revenue:** \$35-50B/year

This is modest compared to carried interest (\$50-80B) or estate planning loopholes (\$90-170B), but meaningful. Most importantly, it's structured to protect middle-class real estate ownership while closing infinite deferral chains.

### **The bottom line**

Real estate doesn't disappear. Landlords don't disappear. Depreciation deductions protect cash flow. 1031 exchanges let investors reinvest proceeds without immediate tax.

What disappears is the ability to defer taxes indefinitely by chaining 1031s across decades and generations. Wealth created in real estate eventually gets taxed — at exit or at death, just like wealth in any other asset class.

## **Q20: How does this affect pass-through businesses (S-Corps, LLCs, partnerships)?**

**Pass-through businesses are treated simply and consistently: business income flows through to the owner's personal return and is taxed as ordinary income. Self-employment taxes are simplified to 12% (keeping the full 6.2% Social Security contribution, which now applies to ALL income with no wage cap). Entrepreneurship is rewarded through a compensation-first structure: owners must draw a fair salary, then can access limited, well-defined capital-gains treatment for sweat equity (see below), and full capital gains treatment at exit.**

The current tax system for pass-through businesses is messy:

* **Self-employment tax** at 15.3%, but capped at ~$160K for Social Security (making it regressive)
* **S-corp owners** minimize W-2 wages and maximize distributions to avoid SE tax
* **"Reasonable compensation" debates** create uncertainty and compliance costs
* **QBI deduction (Section 199A)** adds complexity with phase-outs and restrictions
* **Carried interest loophole** allows compensation to be taxed as capital gains

The Fair & Simple Tax Act simplifies this by: (1) reducing SE tax to 12%, (2) making Social Security tax apply to all income (no cap), (3) eliminating QBI complexity, and (4) treating operational income as ordinary income, with entrepreneurial reward coming at exit via capital gains treatment.

### **How pass-through taxation works under Fair & Simple**

**For all pass-through entities (S-Corps, LLCs, partnerships, Schedule C):**

1. **Wages and self-employment income** — Subject to payroll tax: 12% SE tax (includes 6.2% Social Security on ALL income, no cap + 5.8% Medicare/employer)
2. **Distributions** — Avoid payroll tax (follows current law's reasonable compensation framework)
3. **All income** — Taxed as ordinary income on owner's personal return (no operational capital gains treatment)
4. **At sale/exit** — Capital gains treatment using lifetime exemption, then progressive capital gains rates
5. **QBI deduction (Section 199A)** — Eliminated (simplification)
6. **Carried interest** — Follows the same salary floor + 20% residual allowance (counts against lifetime exemption) as other sweat equity

**The practical effect:**

* **S-Corp owners** still follow reasonable compensation rules (as they do today)
* **Self-employed pay less SE tax** — down from 15.3% to 12%, saving 3.3 percentage points
* **High earners still pay more overall** because Social Security portion (6.2%) applies to ALL income (no wage cap)
* **Small business owners under $250K often break even or come out ahead** because SE tax savings and progressive brackets offset any modest income tax increases
* **No new compliance burdens** — uses existing structures
* **Simpler than current law** — no QBI phase-outs, no arbitrary thresholds
* **Entrepreneurship rewarded at exit** — capital gains on business sale, just like today

### **Sweat equity and carried interest: one unified rule**

* **One rule for everyone** — Small business owners, founders, and VC/PE partners use the same framework; no finance-only carve-outs
* **Compensation floor** — Preferential capital-gains treatment is available only if the individual receives at least $120,000 per year (indexed) in taxable ordinary compensation. Upside cannot replace wages for active work.
* **Reward without forced sales** — Owner-operators can treat a defined share of residual profit as capital gains while running the business; no exit required to recognize some upside
* **Lifetime limits** — All capital gains (including carried interest) count against the lifetime exemption; once used, gains face progressive capital gains rates
* **Pro-entrepreneur, anti-loophole** — Rewards real risk and sweat equity while preventing serial reclassification of labor income as lightly taxed gains

_Note: The three business examples below now apply the $120,000 salary floor and a 20% residual profit sweat-equity allowance (counts against lifetime exemption). Revenue modeling will be updated as we finalize the allowance percentage and any cap._

### **How they compare to W-2 earners at the same income (Option 3)**

* **$350K W-2 (MFJ):** Income tax ~$64,100; payroll ~$27,675 (7.65% + 0.9% surtax over $250K) → **Total ~$91,775 (26.2% effective)**
  * **Dr. Chen (S-Corp $350K with allowance):** ~$67,920 (19.4% effective) — lower than W-2 due to payroll limited to salary and sweat-equity allowance
* **$500K W-2 (MFJ):** Income tax ~$111,600; payroll ~$40,500 (includes 0.9% surtax over $250K) → **Total ~$152,100 (30.4% effective)**
  * **Parkers (S-Corp $500K with allowance):** ~$98,640 (19.7% effective) — much lower than W-2; parity with current law after applying salary floor + allowance

Implication: with the salary floor + 20% allowance, active owners are below W-2 burden at the same income, while still meeting a clear compensation minimum and consuming lifetime exemption for the preferred portion.

---

### **Example: The Parkers' HVAC Business (S-Corp, \$500K profit)**

**Current Law (with typical S-Corp optimization):**
* W-2 salary: \$150K (triggers ~$23K payroll tax, but subject to FICA)
* Distributions: \$350K (zero payroll tax)
* Taxable income: \$500K, but with QBI deduction (~20% reduction) = \$400K effective income
* Income tax at current brackets on \$400K: ~$75K
* **Total federal tax: ~\$98K (19.6% effective rate)** — lower due to S-corp salary planning + QBI

**Under Fair & Simple (Option 3) with sweat-equity allowance:**
* W-2 salary: $120K (payroll tax: 12% = $14,400)
* Residual profit: $380K; **sweat-equity allowance:** 20% of residual = $76K as capital gains (counts toward lifetime exemption)
* Ordinary income taxed: $120K salary + $304K residual = $424K
* Income tax on $424K MFJ at new brackets:
  * $0–$40K @ 4% = $1,600
  * $40–$120K @ 12% = $9,600
  * $120–$400K @ 23% = $64,400
  * $400–$424K @ 36% = $8,640
  * Total ordinary income tax: $84,240
* Capital gains tax on $76K (assumes lifetime exemption remaining): ~$0
* **Total federal tax: ~$98,640 (19.7% effective rate)**
* **Change vs current law: +~$640/year (near parity)**

**The Parkers' take:** "With the salary floor and sweat-equity allowance, we're basically at parity with today. We lose QBI but get to recognize some sweat equity at capital gains rates. Payroll drops to 12%, and we avoid the old salary-vs-distribution games."

---

### **Example: Lisa's LLC Consulting Business (\$250K profit)**

**Current Law:**
* Schedule C income: \$250K
* Self-employment tax: 15.3% on ~\$184K net SE income = \$28,200
* Income tax before QBI: ~$48K; after 20% QBI deduction (~$50K) ≈ $38K
* **Total federal tax: ~\$66,200 (26.5% effective rate)**

**Under Fair & Simple (Option 3) with sweat-equity allowance:**
* Pays herself \$120K (treated as salary for payroll): payroll tax 12% = \$14,400
* Residual profit: \$130K; **sweat-equity allowance:** 20% of residual = \$26K as capital gains (counts toward lifetime exemption)
* Ordinary income taxed: \$120K salary + \$104K residual = \$224K
* Income tax on \$224K: 
  * $0–$40K @ 4% = $1,600
  * $40–$120K @ 12% = $9,600
  * $120–$224K @ 23% = $23,920
  * Total ordinary income tax: $35,120
* Capital gains tax on \$26K (assumes lifetime exemption remaining): ~$0
* **Total federal tax: ~$14,400 + $35,120 = ~$49,520 (19.8% effective rate)**
* **Change vs current law: saves ~$16,700/year**

**Lisa's take:** "This is a win. I meet the $120K salary floor, still pay 12% payroll, and I can treat part of my residual profit as sweat-equity gains. My tax bill drops by ~17K versus today, and I’m doing it cleanly without QBI games."

---

### **Example: Dr. Chen's Medical Practice (S-Corp, \$350K profit)**

**Current Law (typical strategy):**
* W-2 salary: \$130K (payroll tax: ~$20K)
* Distributions: \$220K (zero payroll tax)
* Taxable income: \$350K with QBI deduction (~$280K effective)
* Income tax: ~$45K
* **Total federal tax: ~\$65K (18.6% effective rate)**

**Under Fair & Simple (Option 3) with sweat-equity allowance:**
* W-2 salary: \$120K (payroll tax: 12% = \$14,400)
* Residual profit: \$230K; **sweat-equity allowance:** 20% of residual = \$46K as capital gains (counts toward lifetime exemption)
* Ordinary income taxed: \$120K salary + \$184K residual = \$304K
* Income tax on \$304K: 
  * $0–$40K @ 4% = $1,600
  * $40–$120K @ 12% = $9,600
  * $120–$304K @ 23% = $42,320
  * Total ordinary income tax: $53,520
* Capital gains tax on \$46K (assumes lifetime exemption remaining): ~$0
* **Total federal tax: ~$14,400 + $53,520 = ~$67,920 (19.4% effective rate)**
* **Change vs current law: +~\$2,900/year (near parity)**

**Dr. Chen's take:** "With the salary floor and sweat-equity allowance, I’m basically at parity with today. I still pay 12% payroll on my salary, but I can recognize part of my residual profit as sweat equity. It’s simpler and feels fair."

---

## **How to Read These Examples**

These three examples illustrate the effect of the **salary floor + 20% residual sweat-equity allowance** layered on Option 3.

- **Lisa saves ~$16.7K**: SE tax drops to 12% on salary; 20% of residual profit at cap gains; big net win vs today
- **Dr. Chen is near parity (+~$2.9K)**: Loses QBI but offsets with payroll drop and sweat-equity allowance
- **The Parkers are near parity (+~$0.6K)**: Lose QBI, but salary floor plus 20% sweat-equity allowance and 12% payroll largely offset

**Transparency**: Compensation floor is clear, allowance is formulaic, lifetime exemption caps abuse. No "reasonable compensation" games, no QBI phase-outs.

# **Part 4: Revenue and Fiscal Impact**

## **Q21: How much does this cost, and how is it funded?**

### **The Numbers**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act generates **$300-450B in new annual revenue** on Day 1, making it revenue-positive even after funding major tax relief for working families.

**Revenue Sources (Annual):**

| Source | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Social Security wage cap removal | $150-200B |
| Carried interest reform (salary floor + residual allowance; gross before allowance cost) | $50-80B |
| Buy-borrow-die closure | $50-100B |
| Other loophole closures (QSBS, etc.) | $50-100B |
| **Total New Revenue** | **$300-450B** |

**Costs (Annual):**

| Category | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Income tax bracket cuts (Option 3) | $110-130B |
| SE tax reduction 15.3% → 12% | $50-70B |
| Sweat-equity allowance (salary floor + 20% residual at cap gains, counts vs lifetime exemption) | $30-50B |
| Family benefits ($6,000/child phased $120K–$400K, replaces 3 programs) | Net $54B cost (consolidation offset by increased benefit) |
| **Total Costs (net of child benefit cost)** | **~$154-214B** |

**Net Fiscal Impact: ~$86-296B revenue-positive annually**

This positions the Act as not just fiscally sound, but as a genuine deficit reducer in the long term while providing immediate relief to working families.

---

### **Why not give annual operational tax breaks to business owners?**

**We considered several approaches:**
* Capital return on documented investment (complex, gameable)
* First \$X per person as capital gains (creates W-2 vs. consultant arbitrage)
* Minimum profit thresholds (arbitrary, doesn't help startups)

**The problem:** Every operational tax break either:
1. Creates new gaming opportunities (parking cash, reclassifying income)
2. Favors wealthy investors over sweat equity founders
3. Adds complexity that contradicts "Fair & Simple"

**The solution: Reward entrepreneurship at exit, not annually**

* During operations: All income is ordinary income (clean, simple, hard to game)
* At sale: Full capital gains treatment with \$1.5M lifetime exemption
* This rewards genuine business-building without creating new loopholes

**Example — Sweat Equity Founder:**
* Invests \$0 cash, builds consulting business over 10 years
* Annual profit \$200K: Pays ordinary income tax each year
* Year 10 exit: Sells for \$3M (basis \$0, gain \$3M)
* Uses full \$1.5M exemption (pays \$0) + 15% on \$1.5M = \$225K tax
* **After-tax proceeds: \$2.775M (92.5%)**

That's the reward — you pay ordinary rates on operational cashflow, but when you cash out, you get preferential capital gains treatment. That's fair, simple, and hard to game.

**Why this is fair:** Small business owner gets modest tax advantage for risk, but it's reasonable, not a loophole. And it applies equally whether you're a tech founder, doctor, lawyer, or store owner.

**Example 4: Manufacturing Business (Real Estate Pass-Through)**

**Situation:**
* You invest \$500K in manufacturing equipment/facilities
* Year 8 annual profit: \$800K
* You're in 32% bracket

**Tax calculation:**
* Capital return: 15% × \$500K = \$75K (at capital gains rate)
* Excess profit: \$800K - \$75K = \$725K (at ordinary income rate)
* Tax: (\$75K × 20%) + (\$725K × 32%) = \$15K + \$232K = \$247K
* **Effective rate: ~31%**
* After-tax: \$553K

**Depreciation and 1031 interaction:**
* You also take depreciation deductions on equipment, which reduce ordinary income
* This stacks with the capital return benefit
* If you depreciate \$50K/year, ordinary income is reduced by that amount
* **Result:** Capital return + depreciation deductions create real cash flow benefit for growing businesses

---

### **Comparison: Pass-Through vs. C-Corp vs. Sole Proprietor**

| Business Structure | Owner's \$200K Investment | Annual \$500K Profit | Tax Rate | After-Tax |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pass-through (LLC/S-corp/Partnership)** | 15% capital return | \$500K = \$30K capital + \$470K ordinary | ~31% | ~\$345K |
| **C-Corp** | Retained at 25% corp rate | \$500K corporate profit → \$375K dividend | 25% + 20% = 45% combined | ~\$275K |
| **Sole Proprietor (W-2 equivalent)** | N/A | \$500K all ordinary | 40% | \$300K |
| **Current law arbitrage (S-corp optimized)** | SE tax games | \$500K = \$150K W-2 + \$350K dist. | 15-18% | ~\$407-425K |

**Key insights:**
- **Pass-through is competitive** (saves ~\$45K vs. C-corp, ~\$45K vs. W-2)
- **But not a free loophole** (current law arbitrage saves ~\$60-80K vs. Fair & Simple)
- **Incentive is healthy:** Encourages business formation across all sectors without enabling aggressive tax avoidance

---

### **Why pass-through receives preferential treatment (and other entities don't)**

**Why does pass-through get a 15% capital return, but:**
- **Not C-corps?** C-corps have the option to retain earnings at 25% (lower than ordinary rates), which is their capital retention mechanism. Owners who want preferential treatment can use C-corps, but they accept double taxation trade-off.
- **Not real estate syndicators?** Real estate gets 1031 deferral specifically because housing is essential infrastructure. Pass-throughs don't get similar deferral.
- **Not PE fund managers?** Carried interest is explicitly reclassified as ordinary income (compensation, not capital investment).

**Why does pass-through deserve this?**

Because documented capital investment by an active business owner creates real economic risk and value:

1. **Personal liability** — Owner's personal net worth at risk if business fails
2. **Opportunity cost** — Capital could have been invested in passive index funds (capital gains rates) but was deployed in risky business
3. **Broad-based** — Applies to ALL business types (tech, manufacturing, retail, services, professional practices), not just wealthy entrepreneurs or specific industries
4. **Time-limited** — Benefit expires after 10 years or at sale, forcing eventual realization

---

### **Why the S-Corp election becomes irrelevant**

**Current law benefit of S-corp election:**
* Low W-2 salary + high distributions = save 3-5% in self-employment tax
* Requires careful planning and IRS "reasonable salary" defense
* Creates endless disputes and gaming

**Under Fair & Simple:**
* Both S-corp and LLC/Partnership get identical treatment: 8% ESNC on wages + distributions, then ordinary income
* All profit is ordinary income regardless of entity choice
* **S-corp election becomes irrelevant for tax purposes**
* Owners choose entity structure for business reasons (liability, management, state law), not tax optimization

**Result:** Massive simplification. Business formation decisions are driven by business logic, not tax arbitrage.

---

### **Revenue impact**

**Lower payroll tax burden, but higher income taxes:**

* **Self-employed:** 15.3% SE tax → 8% ESNC = saves ~7.3%
* **S-Corp owners:** Still follow reasonable compensation rules, but save 7.3% on wage portion
* **QBI deduction eliminated:** Adds complexity offset (most businesses pay slightly more on income portion)

**Net revenue: Roughly neutral**

* Savings from lower payroll tax (~\$50B/year)
* Offset by elimination of QBI deduction and closing minor arbitrage games (~\$50B/year)
* **No significant revenue impact from pass-through changes**

This reflects the policy choice: **We're simplifying the system without squeezing small business.**

---

## **Q22: How does this plan handle income earned outside the U.S.?**

**Simple answer: U.S. citizens and residents are taxed on worldwide income using the same rules as domestic income. Foreign earned income is ordinary income. Foreign business income follows pass-through rules. Foreign capital gains use the lifetime exemption. Foreign tax credit continues. GILTI, Subpart F, and PFIC complexity are eliminated.**

The current system for international taxation is unnecessarily complex:

* **GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income)** — Attempts to tax foreign corporate profits at a minimum 10.5% rate, creating massive planning opportunities
* **Subpart F** — Complicated rules that try to prevent deferral of certain foreign income
* **PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company)** — Oppressive rules on foreign mutual funds and corporations
* **Foreign Tax Credit** — Legitimate mechanism to avoid double taxation, but operates alongside the above complexity
* **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)** — Allows \$120K+ of foreign wages to escape U.S. tax if you live abroad

**Problems:** These rules are so complex that they create tax planning opportunities instead of closing them. They discourage legitimate foreign investment and create compliance nightmares for both individuals and multinational corporations.

### **How foreign income works under Fair & Simple**

**Same rules everywhere — apply the same tax code:**

1. **Foreign earned income** — Taxed as ordinary income at regular brackets (5%, 15%, 27%, 38%, 40%, 45%)
2. **Foreign business income** — Follows pass-through rules (8% ESNC for self-employment income, ordinary income rates for business profit)
3. **Foreign capital gains** — Uses lifetime exemption (\$1.5M per person), progressive rates (0%, 15%, 20%, 27%, 32%)
4. **Foreign dividends** — Qualified dividends taxed at capital gains rates (don't use exemption), ordinary dividends as ordinary income
5. **Foreign tax credit** — Continues (credit for foreign taxes paid to avoid double taxation)
6. **GILTI, Subpart F, PFIC** — Eliminated entirely (no special rules for foreign corporations or investors)

**Key principle:** A dollar earned in London, São Paulo, or Tokyo is taxed the same way as a dollar earned in New York. No preferences, no deferral, no special categories.

### **What this eliminates**

**GILTI (the biggest complexity):**
* **Current:** Foreign corporations earning over 10.5% on intangible assets are subject to GILTI taxation
* **Under Fair & Simple:** Foreign corporations are not subject to U.S. tax as entities (they pay 25% corporate tax in their home country). Their dividends paid to U.S. owners are taxed as capital gains (0-32%) when received, consistent with all other dividends.

**Subpart F (deferred income antideferal):**
* **Current:** Certain foreign income (like interest, dividends, royalties) must be included in taxable income in the current year, even if not distributed
* **Under Fair & Simple:** Foreign business income flows through the same way as domestic business income. For pass-through businesses, all business profit is ordinary income whether earned domestically or abroad. For corporations, dividends are taxed when received.

**PFIC (punishment for foreign funds):**
* **Current:** U.S. persons investing in foreign mutual funds face mark-to-market taxation and complicated inclusion rules
* **Under Fair & Simple:** Foreign investments in mutual funds/ETFs are taxed the same as domestic ones. Annual gains inside the fund are not taxed (only when you sell), gains on the sale are capital gains using the lifetime exemption.

**FEIE (foreign earned income exclusion):**
* **Current:** If you live abroad, you can exclude \~\$120K of foreign wages from U.S. tax
* **Under Fair & Simple:** You're taxed on worldwide income regardless of where you live. BUT ordinary brackets are lower (5%, 15%, 27%, 38%, 40%, 45% max), and the tax is applied consistently worldwide.

### **Why this approach wins**

**Clarity:** Same rule everywhere. No special categories, no deferral games, no planning opportunities disguised as "legitimate tax positions."

**Competitiveness:** U.S. businesses competing abroad don't face punitive GILTI rates (currently 10.5%, effectively higher with add-backs). They face the same 25% corporate rate as their foreign competitors.

**Fairness:** A teacher earning \$80K in Chicago pays the same tax as a teacher earning \$80K in London. An investor in Apple stock pays the same tax whether Apple earns profit domestically or abroad (and receives a dividend).

**Compliance:** Foreign tax credit still works. If you pay \$20K in tax to Germany, you can credit it against your U.S. tax bill (up to your U.S. tax liability). This is legitimate and continues.

### **Example: U.S. Expat Working in the UK**

**Situation:** You're a U.S. citizen earning \$200K salary in London, paying \$50K UK tax

**Current law (with FEIE):**
* UK tax: \$50K
* U.S. tax: \$0 (covered by FEIE exclusion)
* **Total tax: \$50K (25% effective rate)**

**Under Fair & Simple:**
* UK tax: \$50K
* U.S. tax: \$200K at ordinary brackets = \$53K
* Foreign Tax Credit: \-\$50K (offset against U.S. tax)
* **Net U.S. tax: \$3K**
* **Total tax: \$53K (26.5% effective rate)**

**Analysis:** Slightly higher tax than FEIE, but: (a) UK tax is already quite high, (b) no more games about where you're "tax resident," (c) you get a real credit for foreign taxes paid, (d) simpler.

**For high earners it's roughly equal,** for lower earners it might be slightly more. But the rule is the same everywhere, and there's no planning involved.

### **Example: U.S. Investor with Foreign Holdings**

**Situation:** You own shares in a UK company and receive dividends; company earns \$100K profit, pays you \$30K dividend

**Current law:**
* GILTI inclusion: Complex — depends on whether it's Subpart F income, whether it's a CFC, whether you have other foreign income
* Foreign Tax Credit: Required to navigate
* Possible deferral: If structured as holding company, profit might not be taxed until you sell

**Under Fair & Simple:**
* Foreign company earns \$100K: Taxed at 25% in UK (normal UK corporation tax)
* Pays you \$30K dividend: You receive it as foreign dividend income
* U.S. tax: \$30K × 0% (if within lifetime exemption for qualified dividends) or 15-32% (if above exemption), per regular rules
* Foreign Tax Credit: UK has already taxed the corporate profit at 25%; this is your credit against dividend tax

**Analysis:** Much simpler. You're taxed on what you actually receive (the dividend), not on theoretical deferred income.

### **Revenue impact**

**International tax reform is broadly revenue-neutral:**

* **GILTI elimination:** Loses revenue (currently raises \~\$10-15B/year), offset by 25% corporate rate increase (raises more revenue overall on foreign subsidiaries)
* **Subpart F elimination:** Simplifies compliance but not major revenue change
* **FEIE elimination:** Small revenue gain (\~\$5-10B/year from high-earning expats)
* **PFIC simplification:** Compliance benefit (people actually comply), minimal revenue impact

**Net:** Roughly breaks even. The real benefit is compliance, simplicity, and end to "tax planning" strategies that don't reflect economic reality.

### **International competitiveness**

U.S. businesses no longer face GILTI penalties when earning abroad. They compete on level footing with foreign businesses paying their home country's corporate rate (typically 20-25%). This makes U.S. investment and business operations more competitive globally.

---

## **Q23: How do trusts work under this plan? Can I use them to avoid paying tax forever?**

**No. Trusts can still be used for estate planning, liability protection, and managing beneficiary distribution — but not for tax deferral. Income retained in a trust is taxed to the trust at the top marginal rate (45%) in the year earned. Distributions to beneficiaries are taxed as ordinary income (or capital gains if the trust distributes capital gains). The lifetime capital gains exemption is per-person and doesn't transfer through trusts or multiply across generations.**

The current system allows wealthy families to use trusts for permanent tax deferral:

* **Dynasty trusts** accumulate income and never distribute, deferring tax indefinitely
* **Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)** transfer appreciating assets tax-free (covered in Q16)
* **Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)** use below-market loans to shift wealth
* **Perpetual trusts in some states** (like Alaska, Nevada) let assets grow tax-free across generations

Fair & Simple eliminates the tax deferral game without disrupting legitimate trust uses.

### **How trusts are taxed under Fair & Simple**

**For income retained by the trust:**
* **Income stays in trust** = Trust pays 45% tax on that income in the year earned
* No multi-generational deferral, no accumulation strategy

**For distributions to beneficiaries:**
* **Ordinary income distributed** = Beneficiary pays ordinary income tax at their rate
* **Capital gains distributed** = Beneficiary uses their portion of lifetime exemption, then pays capital gains rates
* **Principal (non-income) distributed** = Tax-free (it's already been taxed at some point)

**For the lifetime capital gains exemption:**
* Each person gets one \$1.5M exemption (couples \$3M), usable any time during life or at death
* **Exemption does not transfer through trusts or multiply across family members**
* If you use your \$1.5M exemption during life, your kids get their own fresh \$1.5M at their death/during their life
* No dynasty planning, no exemption multiplication

### **Example: Family Accumulation Trust**

**Current Law:**
* You create a trust, fund it with \$10M in stocks
* Trust accumulates dividends and capital gains (doesn't distribute)
* Over 30 years: Grows to \$30M, gains \$20M unrealized
* At your death: Heirs get step-up basis, inherit \$30M tax-free
* **Tax on \$20M of gains: \$0**

**Under Fair & Simple:**
* You create a trust, fund it with \$10M in stocks
* Trust earns \$1M in annual dividends and gains
* Trust pays 45% tax (\$450K) on that income each year
* Over 30 years: Trust pays \~\$13.5M in accumulated income tax
* Remaining growth (\$16.5M) still taxable to heirs when distributed
* **Tax on \$20M of gains: \~\$13.5M + ongoing tax on distributions**

**Result:** Trust is still useful for management and liability protection, but not for tax deferral. Wealthy families can't park assets in a trust and avoid tax forever.

### **Why this closes the loophole**

**Current system:** Defer income in trust, never distribute, heirs get step-up basis, multigenerational wealth compounds tax-free.

**Fair & Simple:** 
1. Deferral is expensive (45% annual tax on retained income)
2. Step-up basis is gone (exit = realization)
3. Exemption doesn't multiply (one per person, not per dynasty)

**Result:** Trusts are still valuable for non-tax reasons (management, creditor protection, probate avoidance), but they can't be used as permanent tax vehicles.

### **What trusts can still do**

* **Estate planning:** Distribute to heirs over time, control beneficiary access
* **Creditor protection:** Protect assets from beneficiary's creditors/litigation
* **Spendthrift provisions:** Keep beneficiary from squandering assets
* **Tax-efficient distribution:** Distribute to lower-bracket beneficiaries, but this is ordinary tax planning, not deferral

Basically: Use a trust if you want to manage how/when heirs get money, or protect assets. Don't use a trust expecting to avoid tax — that's gone.

## **Appendix A: Revenue Model**

### **Executive Summary**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act is **revenue-positive starting Year 1** thanks to strong loophole closures and the Great Conversion windfall. Years 1-5 net $500B-$900B annually depending on scenario. Beyond Year 5, the simplified system generates automatic benefits — government efficiency, GDP growth from reduced deadweight loss, and improved compliance. If additional revenue is needed, we've built a foundation that makes future adjustments straightforward.

---

### **Current Federal Revenue Baseline (\~\$4.5T)**

| Source | Current Revenue |
| :---- | :---- |
| Individual Income Tax | \$2.2T |
| Payroll Tax (FICA) | \$1.5T |
| Corporate Tax | \$420B |
| Estate/Gift Tax | \$35B |
| Other | \$345B |

---

### **Costs (Revenue We Lose)**

| Change | Annual Cost | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Income bracket adjustments | \-\$110–130B | Six slightly more progressive brackets (4%, 12%, 23%, 36%, 39%, 45%); eliminates AMT and NIIT |

| Pass-through allowance ($120K salary + 20% residual) | \-\$30–50B | Applies to pass-through businesses; counts toward capital gains exemption |
| Child benefits consolidation | \-\$50–60B | Consolidates CTC/EITC/Childcare (current: \$276B) into \$6,000/child with phase-out (\$330B) |
| **Total Annual Costs** | **\-\$240–310B** | |

---

### **Gains (Revenue We Add)**

| Change | Annual Revenue | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Social Security wage cap eliminated; 6.2% applies to all wages | \+\$150–200B | Extends Social Security payroll tax to all earnings (no cap) |
| Higher capital gains rates and loophole closures | \+\$50–80B | Carried interest: \$120K salary + 20% residual allowance |
| QSBS eliminated; replaced with universal lifetime exemption | \+\$10–20B | All founders/investors get \$1.5M lifetime exemption |
| Stepped-up basis eliminated at death | \+\$75–100B | Unrealized gains taxed at death using lifetime exemption |
| Buy-Borrow-Die (asset-backed borrowing rule) | \+\$25–50B | Deemed sale on appreciated asset borrowing |
| Real estate/1031 exchange reform | \+\$35–50B | Immediate realization on non-reinvested proceeds |
| Capital gains rates (15%, 20%, 27%, 32% progressive above exemption) | \+\$100–130B | Progressive taxation of gains above \$1.5M lifetime exemption |
| Corporate rate (21% → 25%) | \+\$80B | Standard rate increase |
| Estate tax reform (\$14M → \$5M exemption) | \+\$50–65B | \~30K estates taxed vs. ~4K currently |
| Mortgage interest deduction elimination | \+\$70–90B | Replaced with standard deduction for all |
| SALT deduction elimination (replaced with universal credit) | Neutral | Eliminated deduction; replaced with automatic universal credit |
| Pre-filled returns & reduced tax gap (simplification = compliance) | \+\$50–100B | \~95% of filers get pre-filled returns; capture \~10% of \$600B+ gap |
| **Total Annual Gains** | **\+\$745–1,085B** | |

### **Years 1-20: The Transition Trust Fund Bridge**

The Great Conversion offers holders of pre-tax retirement accounts (Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA, SEP, SIMPLE) a one-time deal: convert to ASA at a 12% tax rate, payable over 10 years.

**The Lockbox Mechanism:** While the tax payments from the Great Conversion are collected over 10 years, the **Transition Trust Fund** releases them into the budget over **20 years**.

* **Total Collections:** \~\$1.2 Trillion (collected Years 1–10)  
* **Trust Fund Payout:** \$60 Billion/year (guaranteed Years 1–20)

**Why this matters:** This lowers the "annual revenue" appearing in the budget during the early years (preventing Congress from spending a temporary surplus) and fills the gap in Years 11–20, acting as a bridge until the structural benefits of GDP growth and efficiency fully mature.

**Years 1-5 Net Position (Budgeted):**

| Scenario | Annual Costs | Annual Gains | Trust Fund Payout | Net |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Conservative | \-\$310B | \+\$745B | \+\$60B | **\+\$495B** |
| Mid | \-\$275B | \+\$915B | \+\$60B | **\+\$700B** |
| Optimistic | \-\$240B | \+\$1,085B | \+\$60B | **\+\$905B** |


**Conclusion:** With the Transition Trust Fund smoothing the curve and strong loophole closures driving immediate gains, the plan is solidly revenue-positive from Day 1, generating $500B-$900B annually in Years 1-5.

### **Years 6+: Automatic Benefits**

Three structural changes generate ongoing revenue/savings without legislative action:

#### **1\. Government Efficiency (+\$20-50B/year)**

| Savings Source | Estimate | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| IRS workforce optimization | \$5-10B | 95% file-free \= fewer processors needed |
| Reduced audits | \$3-5B | Simpler code \= less to audit |
| Reduced tax court/litigation | \$1-2B | Fewer disputes, clearer rules |
| Reduced compliance assistance | \$2-3B | Fewer help calls, simpler forms |
| Fraud reduction | \$5-15B | Third-party reporting, automated matching |
| **Total Government Savings** | **\$16-35B** |  |

 

#### **2\. GDP Growth from Reduced Deadweight Loss (+\$50-150B/year by Year 10\)**

The current tax system imposes massive economic drag:

| Drag Source | Annual Cost | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Compliance time | \$213B | 7.1 billion hours × \$30/hr average |
| Professional tax services | \$30B | H\&R Block, CPAs, tax attorneys |
| Behavioral distortions | \$100-200B | Decisions made for tax reasons, not economic ones |
| Capital misallocation | \$50-100B | Money in tax shelters vs. productive investment |
| Entrepreneurship suppression | Unquantified | Complexity discourages small business formation |
| **Total Deadweight Loss** | **\$400-550B** | \~2% of GDP |

 

**If we reclaim 25-50% of this deadweight loss:**

* Economic activity increases by \$100-275B  
* At \~20% effective federal tax rate \= **\$20-55B** direct revenue  
* Plus multiplier effects: higher wages → more income tax, more spending → more economic activity  
* **Conservative estimate:** 0.5-1% GDP boost over 10 years \= **\$50-100B/year** additional federal revenue by Year 10

#### **3\. Shrinking Tax Gap (+\$50-100B/year)**

The current "tax gap" (taxes owed but not collected) exceeds **\$600B annually**. Our reforms directly address the causes:

| Reform | Tax Gap Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Automated filing | Eliminates errors, catches underreporting |
| Third-party reporting | Brokerages report lifetime gains, employers report wages |
| Simpler rules | Fewer "gray areas" to exploit |
| Fewer deductions | Less opportunity for fraud |

 
**Conservative estimate:** Capture an additional 10-15% of the tax gap \= **\$60-90B/year**

---

### **Years 6+ Summary**

| Automatic Benefit | Annual Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Government efficiency | \+\$20-50B |
| GDP growth (deadweight loss) | \+\$50-150B |
| Reduced tax gap | \+\$50-100B |
| **Total Automatic Benefits** | **\+\$120-300B** |
 

Even in the conservative scenario, the combination of the Transition Trust Fund payout (+\$50B/year until Year 20\) plus automatic benefits puts us solidly in positive territory.

### **Revenue Model Summary**

| Period | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Years 1-5** | Revenue-positive (+\$495-905B annually) | Trust Fund \+ loophole closures |
| **Years 6-20** | Revenue-positive (+\$210-400B annually) | Trust Fund \+ automatic benefits |
| **Years 20+** | Revenue-positive (+\$140-350B annually) | Automatic benefits continue |

 

**Bottom line:** This plan doesn't rely on heroic assumptions or gimmicks. It generates immediate revenue from loophole closures, structural benefits from simplification, and creates a foundation for long-term fiscal sustainability.

## **Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability**

### **Meet in the Middle: Revenue Reform + Spending Reform**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act is **revenue-positive from Day 1**, generating \$140–350B annually. This represents our contribution to fiscal sustainability — now we need the same bold approach on the spending side.

#### **The Fiscal Context**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | \~\$1.7T (\~6% of GDP) | \~\$840B-1.12T (3-4% of GDP) | \~\$580-860B |
| **GDP (current)** | \~\$28 Trillion | Growing 2-3% annually | Denominator effect helps |

 

**Key insight:** We don't need to eliminate the deficit entirely — most economists agree 3-4% of GDP is sustainable long-term. Plus, GDP growth naturally reduces deficit burden over time. The goal is to get from 6% to 3-4% of GDP.

**This Act's contribution:** \$140-350B annually (closes 16-60% of the gap)  
**Spending reform needed:** \$230-720B annually (closes the rest)

**That's meeting in the middle.** Revenue reform and spending reform, both applying the same principles: simplicity, fairness, and durability.

---

### **Two-Track Approach to Sustainability**

Achieving fiscal sustainability requires parallel action on both sides:

#### **Revenue Side (This Act): \~\$140-350B**
✓ Close loopholes that benefit ultra-wealthy  
✓ Simplify code to reduce deadweight loss  
✓ Broaden base and improve compliance  
✓ Eliminate stepped-up basis, buy-borrow-die, carried interest abuse  
✓ Progressive capital gains, uncapped Social Security  

#### **Spending Side (Future Legislation): \~\$1.0-1.4T**
The same principles that guide this Act — simplicity, fairness, durability — should guide spending reform:

**Simplicity:**
- Consolidate duplicative programs (current: 80\+ workforce programs, 40\+ housing programs)
- Eliminate obsolete agencies and outdated authorizations
- Streamline procurement and reduce administrative overhead
- Modernize government IT systems (reduces fraud, improves efficiency)

**Fairness:**
- Means-test benefits for high earners (Medicare, Social Security above certain income thresholds)
- Reform corporate subsidies and industry-specific tax breaks that survived this Act
- Reduce spending on programs that disproportionately benefit wealthy (e.g., flood insurance in expensive coastal areas)

**Durability:**
- Address entitlement growth curves (Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid)
- Reform defense procurement waste (not defense capability)
- Index programs to inflation/GDP automatically to prevent ad-hoc budgeting
- Create bipartisan commission with enforcement mechanism

**Realistic Savings Potential:**

| Category | Potential Annual Savings | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Entitlement reforms (means-testing, fraud reduction) | \$150-300B | Without cutting benefits for middle class |
| Defense procurement efficiency | \$40-80B | Without reducing capability |
| Program consolidation/elimination | \$80-150B | Reduce duplication and administrative costs |
| Federal workforce/IT modernization | \$20-40B | Automation, efficiency gains |
| Interest savings (from deficit reduction) | \$100-300B | Compounding effect over 10 years |
| **Total Potential Savings** | **\$390-870B** | Combined with this Act: \$530B-1.22T |

 

**Plus GDP growth:** At 2-3% nominal GDP growth, the deficit naturally shrinks as % of GDP — turning a 6% problem into a 5% problem, then 4%, even if absolute dollars hold steady.

---

### **Our Position: Both Sides Must Contribute**

**This Act handles the revenue side** (\$140-350B). We've closed loopholes, simplified the code, and created a progressive system that asks more from those who've benefited most.

**Spending reform should contribute equally** (\$230-720B). The same bold thinking that reformed the tax code should reform spending: consolidate programs, eliminate waste, means-test benefits for high earners.

**Together:** Tax reform \+ spending reform \+ GDP growth = sustainable 3-4% deficit within 5-10 years.

**We do NOT support:**
- VAT or carbon taxes **until after comprehensive spending reform**
- Raising rates on middle class
- Eliminating the standard deduction or child benefits
- Creating new taxes to fund new programs

---

### **If All Else Fails: Emergency Revenue Options**

Should Congress exhaust spending reforms and still face structural deficits, the simplified tax base makes future adjustments straightforward. **These are emergency measures only, NOT recommended policy:**

| Emergency Option | Annual Revenue | Why This Is Last Resort |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Carbon Tax** (\$50/ton) | \+\$100-150B | Regressive; requires rebates; best as offset for other cuts |
| **Financial Transaction Tax** (0.1%) | \+\$50-100B | May reduce market liquidity; punishes retirement savers |
| **Value-Added Tax** (10%) | \+\$800B-1T | Extremely regressive; would require massive rebate system |
| **Higher ESNC** (8% → 9%) | \+\$130B | Employer-side tax increase; may reduce wages |
| **Corporate Rate** (25% → 28%) | \+\$60B | Reduces competitiveness; encourages offshoring |
| **Estate Exemption** (\$5M → \$3M) | \+\$20-30B | Hits small business succession; family farms |

**Total Emergency Revenue: \+\$1.16-1.49T**

 

**Why we list these:** Transparency. If critics claim "your plan doesn't balance the budget," we can show the full menu. But we oppose implementing these options **until spending reform has been exhausted.**

---

### **Sequencing Matters**

**Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Pass This Act**
- Revenue-positive from Day 1
- Simplifies code, improves compliance
- Demonstrates Congress can tackle hard problems
- **Contribution: \$140-350B annually**

**Phase 2 (Years 2-5): Spending Reform**
- Apply same principles (simplicity, fairness, durability) to spending
- Bipartisan commission with enforcement mechanism
- Program consolidation, means-testing, procurement reform
- **Target: \$230-720B in annual savings**

**Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Let GDP Growth Work**
- 2-3% annual GDP growth naturally reduces deficit burden
- Deficit falls from 6% → 4% → 3% of GDP
- Structural reforms compound over time
- **Result: Sustainable fiscal path without draconian cuts or massive tax increases**

---

### **Bottom Line**

**This Act generates \$140-350B annually.** That's meeting our commitment on the revenue side — closing loopholes, asking more from the wealthy, creating a simpler system.

**Now Congress needs to match that effort on spending.** Not draconian cuts. Not eliminating Medicare. Just smart reforms: consolidate duplicative programs, means-test benefits for high earners, eliminate waste.

**Revenue reform \+ spending reform \+ GDP growth = fiscal sustainability.**

**That's not just policy. That's partnership.**

## **Appendix A-1: Tax Burden by Income Percentile**

This table shows the distributional impact of the Fair & Simple Tax Act across income levels, demonstrating that the reform is **progressive** — most households pay less or about the same, while high earners contribute more.

### **Household Tax Impact by Income Percentile**

| Income Percentile | Representative Income | Current Effective Rate | Fair & Simple Rate | Change | Annual $ Change | Who Wins/Loses |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bottom 20%** | \$25,000 | 10.5% | 8.2% | -2.3 pts | **-\$575** | ✓ Wins |
| **20-40%** | \$45,000 | 14.8% | 12.5% | -2.3 pts | **-\$1,035** | ✓ Wins |
| **40-60%** | \$75,000 | 17.2% | 15.8% | -1.4 pts | **-\$1,050** | ✓ Wins |
| **60-80%** | \$125,000 | 19.5% | 18.9% | -0.6 pts | **-\$750** | ✓ Wins |
| **80-90%** | \$200,000 | 21.8% | 21.5% | -0.3 pts | **-\$600** | ✓ ~Even |
| **90-95%** | \$300,000 | 23.5% | 24.2% | +0.7 pts | **+\$2,100** | Pays more |
| **95-99%** | \$500,000 | 26.2% | 28.5% | +2.3 pts | **+\$11,500** | Pays more |
| **Top 1% (99-99.9%)** | \$1.5M | 28.5% | 32.8% | +4.3 pts | **+\$64,500** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.1%** | \$5M | 29.8% | 35.2% | +5.4 pts | **+\$270,000** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.01%** | \$25M | 23.1% | 37.5% | +14.4 pts | **+\$3.6M** | Pays dramatically more |

*Note: Current effective rates include FICA, federal income tax, and account for common deductions/loopholes. Fair & Simple rates include ESNC (employer-side only) and income tax with no loopholes.*

### **Key Findings**

**80% of households pay less or about the same:**
- Bottom 80% save between \$575 and \$1,050 per year
- Primary drivers: FICA elimination, lower brackets for <\$150K earners

**Top 20% split:**
- 80-90th percentile (~even): Modest changes
- 90-99th percentile (pays more): Higher brackets + fewer deductions
- Top 1% (pays significantly more): Loophole closures + progressive capital gains

**The Top 0.01% sees the largest increase:**
- Currently effective rate: 23.1% (due to stepped-up basis, carried interest, estate planning)
- Fair & Simple rate: 37.5%
- Increase: +14.4 percentage points
- **This is where the revenue comes from** — closing loopholes that only ultra-wealthy can access

### **Revenue Composition by Income Group**

| Income Group | Share of Total Income | Current Tax Share | Fair & Simple Tax Share | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bottom 50% | 12% | 3% | 2% | -1 pt |
| 50-90% | 38% | 30% | 28% | -2 pts |
| 90-99% | 32% | 38% | 40% | +2 pts |
| Top 1% | 18% | 29% | 30% | +1 pt |

**Result:** The system becomes slightly more progressive. The bottom 90% contributes less as a share of total revenue, while the top 10% contributes more.

### **Political Messaging**

✓ **"80% of Americans will pay less or about the same"**  
✓ **"Middle-class families save \$750-\$1,000/year"**  
✓ **"Billionaires can't dodge taxes anymore — they'll pay their fair share"**  
✓ **"We're closing loopholes, not raising taxes on working families"**

### **Why the Top 0.01% Currently Pay Only 23%**

The ultra-wealthy avoid taxes through:
1. **Stepped-up basis** — \$75-100B/year never taxed
2. **Buy-borrow-die** — Live on loans, never realize gains
3. **Carried interest** — Compensation taxed as capital gains
4. **Dynasty trusts** — Wealth compounds tax-free across generations
5. **Estate planning** — GRATs, FLPs, valuation discounts

Fair & Simple eliminates ALL of these loopholes, which is why their effective rate nearly doubles.

*Fair & Simple: \$0 on \$1.5M \+ 15% × \$1.5M \+ 20% × \$5M \= \$0 \+ \$225K \+ \$1M \= \$1.225M on \$8M. Wait, let me recalc:*

*\$0-\$1.5M: 0%. \$1.5M-\$3M: 15% × \$1.5M \= \$225K. \$3M-\$10M: 20% × \$6.5M \= \$1.3M. Total on \$9.5M gain \= \$225K \+ \$1.3M \= \$1.525M*

**Without QSBS:**

**Kevin's take:** "I didn't qualify for QSBS because my company was in consulting. Under the old rules I'd pay \$1.9M. Now I pay \$1.5M. I'll take it."

**Sarah's take:** "About the same. I don't get special treatment anymore, but I also don't need a team of lawyers to figure it out."

**The take:** "The carried interest loophole is gone. I pay about \$5M more. That's the deal."

### **Part C: Inheritance**

#### **17\. Trust Fund Heir — Inherits \$20M**

**Decedent's situation:**

* Total estate: \$20M  
* Cost basis: \$5M  
* Unrealized gain: \$15M  
* Lifetime cap gains exemption: Never used (\$1.5M remaining)

**Step 1: Capital Gains at Death**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Unrealized Gain | \$15,000,000 |
| Lifetime Exemption Remaining | \-\$1,500,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$13,500,000 |
| Tax: 15% on \$1.5M | \$225,000 |
| Tax: 20% on \$7M | \$1,400,000 |
| Tax: 25% on \$3.5M | \$875,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$2,500,000** |

 

**Step 2: Estate Tax**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Gross Estate | \$20,000,000 |
| Less: Cap Gains Tax Paid | \-\$2,500,000 |
| Net Estate | \$17,500,000 |
| Less: Estate Exemption | \-\$5,000,000 |
| Taxable Estate | \$12,500,000 |
| Estate Tax (40%) | **\$5,000,000** |

 

**Total Taxes at Death:** \$2,500,000 \+ \$5,000,000 \= **\$7,500,000**

**Heir Receives:** \$20,000,000 \- \$7,500,000 \= **\$12,500,000**

**Effective Tax Rate on Estate:** 37.5%

**Comparison to Current Law:**

* Current: Step-up eliminates cap gains, \$14M exemption covers estate \= **\$0 tax**  
* Fair & Simple: **\$7.5M tax**

**The heir's take:** "I'm still inheriting \$12.5 million dollars. My parents paid taxes on their gains like everyone else. That's fair."

| Inheritance | \$20M estate | 0% | 37.5% | **\+37.5 pts** |

**The Pattern:**

* Workers under \$150K: Win (FICA elimination)  
* Self-employed: Roughly neutral (SE tax cut offsets higher brackets)  
* Families with kids: Win (FICA \+ expanded CTC)  
* High earners (\$500K+): Pay more (higher brackets)  
* Capital gains under \$1.5M: Tax-free (lifetime exemption)  
* Large exits: About the same (no QSBS, but simpler)  
* Inheritance: Pay much more (step-up eliminated)

## **Appendix C: Borrowing Rule Case Studies**

The Borrowing Rule prevents the "Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy by treating loans against appreciated assets (above cost basis) as taxable events. Here's how it works in practice.

---

### **Case 1: The Cape Cod Doctor**

**Dr. Sarah Chen, 58, Primary Care Physician**

**Situation:**

* Owns vacation home in Cape Cod, bought 20 years ago for \$200,000  
* Current value: \$1,200,000  
* Unrealized gain: \$1,000,000  
* Wants to borrow \$400,000 for daughter's medical school tuition

**Under Current Law:**

* Takes home equity loan for \$400,000  
* No tax triggered  
* Plans to hold until death, when step-up eliminates gain  
* Daughter graduates, loan gets paid off over time  
* Total tax on \$1M appreciation: **\$0**

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$200,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$400,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$200,000 |
| Capital Gains Tax (15% rate\*) | **\$30,000** |
| New Basis | \$400,000 |

 

*Assumes she has used none of her \$1.5M lifetime exemption. If fully unused, this \$200K gain would be tax-free.*

**If she's already used her lifetime exemption:**

* \$200,000 × 15% \= \$30,000 tax  
* She still gets the \$400,000 loan  
* Her basis is now \$400,000  
* Remaining unrealized gain: \$800,000

**Dr. Chen's take:** "I paid \$30,000 in taxes to access \$400,000. That's a 7.5% 'cost' — less than the interest rate on most loans. And I won't owe tax on that \$200K again when I sell."

---

### **Case 2: The Tech IPO Founder**

**Marcus Williams, 42, Software Startup Founder**

**Situation:**

* Founded company 10 years ago, owns 5% post-IPO  
* Shares worth \$50,000,000  
* Cost basis: \$50,000 (original investment)  
* Unrealized gain: \$49,950,000  
* Wants to buy a \$10M house without selling shares (to avoid signaling, maintain control)

**Under Current Law:**

* Pledges \$15M in stock as collateral  
* Borrows \$10M from private bank at 5%  
* No tax triggered  
* Pays interest-only, rolls loan indefinitely  
* At death, step-up eliminates \$50M gain  
* Total tax: **\$0** (plus \~\$500K/year in interest)

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$50,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$10,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$9,950,000 |
| Lifetime Exemption | \-\$1,500,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$8,450,000 |
| Tax Calculation |  |
| — 15% on \$1.5M (\$1.5M-\$3M) | \$225,000 |
| — 20% on \$5.45M (\$3M-\$8.45M) | \$1,090,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$1,315,000** |
| New Basis | \$10,000,000 |

 

**Marcus's situation after borrowing:**

* Paid: \$1,315,000 in capital gains tax  
* Received: \$10,000,000 loan  
* Net proceeds: \$8,685,000  
* New basis: \$10,000,000  
* Remaining shares: \$40M in value, \$40M in unrealized gain  
* Lifetime exemption: Fully used

**Marcus's take:** "I paid \$1.3M to access \$10M. Under the old system I'd have paid \$0, but I also would have had to keep rolling debt forever. Now I own the house free and clear, my basis is reset, and I know exactly where I stand."

---

### **Case 3: The Inherited Wealth Heir**

**Elizabeth "Bitsy" Thornton IV, 35, Trust Beneficiary**

**Situation:**

* Inherited \$30M in diversified stocks from grandmother  
* Grandmother's basis: \$3M (90% unrealized gain)  
* Under current law, Bitsy received step-up to \$30M basis  
* Under Fair & Simple, estate paid cap gains tax; Bitsy inherited with \$30M basis  
* Bitsy wants to borrow \$5M to buy apartment in Manhattan

**Under Current Law (with step-up):**

* Basis: \$30M (stepped up at death)  
* Borrows \$5M against portfolio  
* No tax (loan is under basis)  
* Total tax: **\$0**

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

* Grandmother's estate paid \~\$6.5M in capital gains tax at death  
* Bitsy inherited with \$30M basis (clean)  
* Borrows \$5M against portfolio  
* Loan (\$5M) \< Basis (\$30M)  
* **No additional tax triggered**

**Bitsy's take:** "My grandmother's estate paid taxes that had been deferred for 40 years. I inherited less, but with a clean basis. Now I can borrow, sell, or hold without worrying about a hidden tax bill."

### **Case 4: The Serial Entrepreneur**

**Raj Patel, 55, Third-Time Founder**

**Situation:**

* Sold first company: \$2M gain (used \$1.5M exemption, paid 15% on \$500K \= \$75K)  
* Sold second company: \$5M gain (paid 15% on \$1.5M \+ 20% on \$3.5M \= \$925K)  
* Current company worth \$20M (basis \$100K)  
* Wants to borrow \$3M for new venture without selling

**Lifetime Exemption Status:** Fully used

**Borrowing Analysis:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$100,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$3,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$2,900,000 |
| Tax: 15% on \$1.5M | \$225,000 |
| Tax: 20% on \$1.4M | \$280,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$505,000** |
| New Basis | \$3,000,000 |

 

**Raj's take:** "I've had a good run. I've used my exemption, I've paid taxes along the way. \$500K on a \$3M loan is about 17% — not cheap, but I'm accessing \$20M in value without selling control. And my basis keeps going up."

---

### **Case 5: The Real Estate Investor**

**Linda Morrison, 62, Commercial Real Estate**

**Situation:**

* Owns strip mall bought 25 years ago for \$500,000  
* Current value: \$4,000,000  
* Unrealized gain: \$3,500,000  
* Has used \$500K of lifetime exemption on previous sales  
* Remaining exemption: \$1,000,000  
* Wants to borrow \$2M for new property acquisition

**Under Current Law:**

* 1031 exchange into new property (defer all gains)  
* Or borrow \$2M against strip mall, no tax  
* Continue deferring indefinitely  
* Step-up at death

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$500,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$2,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$1,500,000 |
| Remaining Lifetime Exemption | \-\$1,000,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$500,000 |
| Tax (15% rate) | **\$75,000** |
| New Basis | \$2,000,000 |

 

**Linda's take:** "I used up my remaining exemption and paid \$75K on \$500K of gain. My basis is now \$2M. I have \$2M in unrealized gain left, but I can sell or borrow against that too — I just pay as I go."

---

### **Summary: How the Borrowing Rule Works**

| Scenario | Loan | Basis | Above Basis | Tax | New Basis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cape Cod Doctor | \$400K | \$200K | \$200K | \$0-30K\* | \$400K |
| Tech Founder | \$10M | \$50K | \$9.95M | \$1.3M | \$10M |
| Inherited Wealth | \$5M | \$30M | \$0 | \$0 | \$30M |
| Serial Entrepreneur | \$3M | \$100K | \$2.9M | \$505K | \$3M |
| RE Investor | \$2M | \$500K | \$1.5M | \$75K | \$2M |

 

\*Depends on remaining lifetime exemption

**Key Principles:**

1. **Borrow up to basis \= no tax** (that's your money)  
2. **Borrow above basis \= taxable event** (that's appreciation)  
3. **Basis increases by taxed amount** (no double taxation)  
4. **Lifetime exemption applies** (most people pay less than headline rates)  
5. **Applies to all assets** (stocks, real estate, art, private companies)

### **Part D: Pass-Through Business Owners**

#### **18. Small Pass-Through Business — Lisa, LLC Owner, \$250K Profit**

**Situation:**
* Lisa owns a marketing consultancy (LLC)
* Annual business profit: \$250,000 (Schedule C)
* Single filer

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Business Profit | \$250,000 | \$250,000 | — |
| Self-Employment Tax (15.3%) | \$38,250 | \$20,000 | -\$18,250 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$38,456 | \$53,000 | +\$14,544 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$76,706** | **\$73,000** | **-\$3,706** |
| **Effective Rate** | **30.7%** | **29.2%** | **-1.5 pts** |

*Fair & Simple: ESNC (8%) \= \$20K. Income tax at ordinary brackets (no QBI) \= \$53K. Total \= \$73K.*

**Lisa's take:** "I save almost \$4K a year because self-employment tax dropped from 15.3% to 8%. My income taxes went up slightly, but overall I'm ahead and the system is way simpler."

**Lisa's take:** "Same total tax, but way simpler. No more 'reasonable salary' debates with the IRS."

---

#### **19. Mid-Sized Pass-Through — The Parkers, S-Corp, \$500K Profit**

**Situation:**
* The Parkers own a regional HVAC business (S-Corp)
* Annual profit: \$500,000
* Take \$150K W-2 salary, \$350K distributions (reasonable compensation)
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids

**Current Law:**
* W-2 salary \$150K: FICA 15.3% \= \$23K
* Distributions \$350K: avoid FICA
* Income tax on \$500K: \~\$52K
* **Total tax: \~\$71K (14.2% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Business Profit | \$500,000 | \$500,000 | — |
| Payroll Tax (salary only) | \$23,000 | \$12,000 | -\$11,000 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$52,000 | \$98,000 | +\$46,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -\$4,000 | -\$5,000 | -\$1,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$71,000** | **\$105,000** | **+\$34,000** |
| **Effective Rate** | **14.2%** | **21.0%** | **+6.8 pts** |

*Fair & Simple: ESNC (8%) on \$150K salary \= \$12K. Distributions avoid ESNC (same as current). Income tax at ordinary brackets (no QBI) \= \$98K. Less CTC \$5K \= \$105K total.*

**The Parkers' take:** "We pay \$34K more because the QBI deduction is gone and brackets are more progressive. But we're still keeping \$395K after tax, and there's no more stress about whether our \$150K salary is 'reasonable compensation.'"

**The Parkers' take:** "We pay more because we were gaming the system. But we're still keeping \$356,500 after tax vs. \$429,000 under current arbitrage. The certainty is worth it."

---

#### **20. Professional Services — Dr. Chen, Medical Practice, \$350K Profit**

**Situation:**
* Dr. Chen owns a solo medical practice (S-Corp)
* Annual profit: \$350,000
* Takes \$120K W-2 salary, \$230K distributions
* Single filer

**Current Law:**
* W-2 salary \$120K: FICA 15.3% \= \$18K
* Distributions \$230K: avoid FICA
* Income tax: \~\$52K
* **Total tax: \~\$70K (20% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Business Profit | \$350,000 | \$350,000 | — |
| Payroll Tax (salary only) | \$18,000 | \$9,600 | -\$8,400 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$52,000 | \$88,000 | +\$36,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$70,000** | **\$97,600** | **+\$27,600** |
| **Effective Rate** | **20.0%** | **27.9%** | **+7.9 pts** |

*Fair & Simple: ESNC (8%) on \$120K salary \= \$9.6K. Distributions avoid ESNC (same as current). Income tax at ordinary brackets (no QBI) \= \$88K. Total \= \$97.6K.*

**Dr. Chen's take:** "I pay \$27.6K more mainly because the QBI deduction is gone. But I can focus on patients instead of tax planning, and my effective rate is still under 28%."

**Dr. Chen's take:** "I pay significantly more because I was avoiding SE tax. But the simplicity means I can focus on patients instead of tax planning."

### **Part E: Real Estate Investors**

#### **21. Mom-and-Pop Landlords — The Garcias, Two Rental Properties**

**Situation:**
* Own two rental properties worth \$2M total

| **Effective Rate** | **14.1%** | **4.5%** | **-9.6 pts** |

**The Garcias' take:** "The lifetime exemption covers our entire gain. We only pay depreciation recapture—same as current law. We save over \$200K."

#### **22. Large Landlord — Susan, Real Estate Portfolio, \$10M Value**

**Situation:**
* Owns diversified real estate portfolio
* Original basis: \$3M
* Current value: \$10M

| Capital Gains Tax | \$1,316,300 | \$1,025,000 | -\$291,300 |
| **Effective Rate** | **18.8%** | **14.6%** | **-4.2 pts** |

*Fair & Simple: \$0 on \$1.5M + 15% × \$1.5M + 20% × \$4M \= \$0 + \$225K + \$800K \= \$1,025K*

**Susan's take:** "I saved \$291K compared to current law. The 1031 reforms are fair—I got decades of deferral, and now I pay at reasonable rates."

### **Part F: Middle-Class Reassurance (Upper-Middle Earners)**

#### **23. Dual-Income Professional Couple — The Andersons, \$300K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Both work in tech (W-2 employees)
* Combined income: \$300,000
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids
* Mortgage interest: \$20K, state taxes: \$15K
* **Lifetime exemption status:** \$3M available (couple, no capital gains yet)

**Current Law (with SALT deduction):**
* FICA: \$23,000
* Federal income tax: \~\$42,000 (after SALT deduction)
* **Total tax: \~\$65,000 (\~21.7% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Gross Income | \$300,000 | \$300,000 | — |
| Employee FICA (7.65%) | \$23,000 | \$0 | -\$23,000 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$42,000 | \$67,000 | +\$25,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -\$4,000 | -\$5,000 | -\$1,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$61,000** | **\$62,000** | **+\$1,000** |
| **Effective Rate** | **20.3%** | **20.7%** | **+0.4 pts** |

*Fair & Simple income tax (MFJ): 5% × \$40K + 15% × \$80K + 27% × \$180K \= \$2K + \$12K + \$48.6K \= \$62.6K*

**The Andersons' take:** "We pay about \$1,000 more, but we keep the FICA savings and our taxes take 15 minutes instead of hiring a CPA."

#### **24. High-Earning Dual-Income Couple — The Patel-Johnsons, \$500K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Both are corporate executives (W-2)
* Combined income: \$500,000
* Married filing jointly + 3 kids
* Live in high-tax state (SALT: \$25K)
* **Lifetime exemption status:** \$3M available (couple, no capital gains yet)

**Current Law (SALT capped at \$10K):**
* FICA: \$24,000 (capped)
* Federal income tax: \~\$95,000
* **Total tax: \~\$119,000 (\~23.8% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Gross Income | \$500,000 | \$500,000 | — |
| Employee FICA | \$24,000 | \$0 | -\$24,000 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$95,000 | \$154,000 | +\$59,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -\$0 | -\$7,500 | -\$7,500 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$119,000** | **\$146,500** | **+\$27,500** |
| **Effective Rate** | **23.8%** | **29.3%** | **+5.5 pts** |

*Fair & Simple income tax (MFJ): \$2K + \$12K + \$48.6K + \$76K + \$20K \= \$158.6K - CTC \$7.5K \= \$151K*

**The Patel-Johnsons' take:** "We pay about \$27K more, but we're in the top 5% of earners. The system is fairer, and our effective rate is still under 30%."

---

#### **25. Physician Couple — Drs. Martinez, \$600K Combined (W-2)**

**Situation:**
* Both work at hospitals (W-2 employees)
* Combined income: \$600,000
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids
* No significant deductions under current law
* **Lifetime exemption status:** \$3M available (couple, no capital gains yet)

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Gross Income | \$600,000 | \$600,000 | — |
| Employee FICA | \$24,000 | \$0 | -\$24,000 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$125,000 | \$191,000 | +\$66,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -\$0 | -\$5,000 | -\$5,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$149,000** | **\$186,000** | **+\$37,000** |
| **Effective Rate** | **24.8%** | **31.0%** | **+6.2 pts** |

*Fair & Simple income tax (MFJ): \$2K + \$12K + \$48.6K + \$76K + \$56K \= \$194.6K - CTC \$5K \= \$189.6K*

**Drs. Martinez' take:** "We pay \$37K more because we're in the top 2%. But FICA elimination helps, and the system is transparent. No more surprise AMT or phase-outs."

---

#### **26. Small Business Owner + Professional Spouse — The Thompsons, \$400K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Sarah owns a small retail business (S-Corp): \$200K profit
  - Takes \$80K W-2 salary, \$120K distributions
* Mike is a software engineer (W-2): \$200K salary
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids

**Current Law:**
* Sarah: \$80K salary (FICA \~\$12K) + \$120K distributions
* Mike: \$200K salary (FICA \~\$15.3K)
* Combined income tax: \~\$43K
* **Total tax: \~\$70K (17.5% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Combined Income | \$400,000 | \$400,000 | — |
| FICA + ESNC | \$27,300 | \$6,400 | -\$20,900 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$43,000 | \$99,000 | +\$56,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -\$4,000 | -\$5,000 | -\$1,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$66,300** | **\$100,400** | **+\$34,100** |
| **Effective Rate** | **16.6%** | **25.1%** | **+8.5 pts** |

*Fair & Simple:*
- *Sarah's ESNC: 8% × \$80K salary \= \$6,400 (distributions avoid ESNC)*
- *Mike's FICA: \$0*
- *Combined income tax at ordinary brackets (no QBI): \~\$99K*
- *Less CTC: -\$5,000*
- *Total: \$6,400 + \$99,000 - \$5,000 \= \$100,400*

**The Thompsons' take:** "We pay \$34K more mainly because Mike's FICA elimination (\$15K savings) doesn't fully offset our higher income taxes from losing the QBI deduction. But we're in the top 10% of earners, and the simplicity is worth it."

## **Appendix D: Great Conversion Details**

The Great Conversion offers a one-time opportunity to convert pre-tax retirement accounts to the new American Savings Account (ASA) at a deeply discounted 12% tax rate.

---

### **Why Convert?**

**The Math:**

| Scenario | Tax Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Normal withdrawal (current law) | 22-37% |
| Great Conversion | **12%** |
| Savings | **10-25 percentage points** |

 

A \$500,000 Traditional 401(k) converted today:

* Normal withdrawal tax: \$110,000 \- \$185,000  
* Great Conversion tax: \$60,000  
* **Savings: \$60,000 \- \$135,000**

Plus: All future growth and withdrawals are tax-free.

---

### **Eligible Accounts**

**Can Convert:**

* Traditional 401(k)  
* Traditional IRA  
* 403(b)  
* 457(b)  
* SEP-IRA  
* SIMPLE IRA

**Automatic Conversion (no action needed):**

* Roth 401(k) → ARA  
* Roth IRA → ARA  
* (Same tax treatment, just new name)

**Not Eligible:**

* HSA (remains separate)  
* Taxable brokerage accounts (not retirement accounts)

---

### **How It Works**

**Step 1: Elect to Convert**

* 3-year enrollment window after bill passage  
* Convert all or part of pre-tax balance  
* Can convert in stages (Year 1: \$200K, Year 2: \$300K, etc.)

**Step 2: Calculate Tax**

* 10% of converted balance  
* Example: Convert \$400,000 → \$40,000 tax

**Step 3: Payment Options**

* **Option A:** Pay in full (one-time)  
* **Option B:** Pay over 10 years, interest-free  
  * \$40,000 tax ÷ 10 years \= \$4,000/year  
  * Added to annual tax bill  
  * No penalties for early payoff

**Step 4: Account Becomes ASA**

* Converted funds now in ASA  
* All future growth tax-free  
* Withdrawals after age 60 tax-free  
* Subject to ASA rules (\$2.5M lifetime cap)

---

### **Case Studies**

#### **Case 1: The Early Retiree**

**Tom, 55, recently retired**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$800,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$80,000 |
| Payment Plan | \$8,000/year for 10 years |

 

**Tom's Analysis:**

* He expects to be in the 25% bracket during retirement  
* Without conversion: \$800K × 25% \= \$200,000 in taxes over time  
* With conversion: \$80,000 total  
* **Savings: \$120,000**

"I'm paying \$8,000 a year for 10 years to save \$120,000 in lifetime taxes. That's a no-brainer."

---

#### **Case 2: The Mid-Career Professional**

**Aisha, 40, software engineer**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$350,000 |
| Expected Balance at 65 (7% growth) | \$1,890,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$35,000 |

 

**Aisha's Analysis:**

* If she doesn't convert, the \$350K grows to \$1.89M  
* Taxed at withdrawal: \$1.89M × 25% \= \$472,500  
* If she converts now: \$35,000 tax, then \$1.89M withdraws tax-free  
* **Savings: \$437,500**

"The earlier you convert, the more you save. 25 years of tax-free growth is incredible."

---

#### **Case 3: The High Earner Approaching Retirement**

**James, 62, executive**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$2,000,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$200,000 |
| Payment Plan | \$20,000/year for 10 years |

 

**Complication:** ASA has a \$2.5M lifetime cap. James needs to plan carefully.

**James's Strategy:**

* Convert \$2M to ASA (at \$2.5M cap, room for some growth)  
* Pay \$200K over 10 years  
* Expected withdrawals in 35% bracket without conversion: \$700,000 in taxes  
* **Savings: \$500,000**

"Even at \$2M, the conversion saves me half a million. The cap doesn't hurt me because I'm near retirement anyway."

---

#### **Case 4: The Partial Converter**

**Maria, 45, small business owner**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| SEP-IRA Balance | \$600,000 |
| Current Income Tax Bracket | 35% |
| Expected Retirement Bracket | 25% |

 

**Maria's Analysis:**

* She's in a high bracket now, will be lower in retirement  
* Still, 10% \< 25%, so conversion wins  
* But she wants to hedge: converts \$300,000 now, waits on rest

**Partial Conversion:**

* Year 1: Convert \$300,000 → \$30,000 tax  
* Year 3 (end of window): Convert remaining \$350,000 → \$35,000 tax  
* **Total tax: \$65,000**

"I converted half immediately and waited to see how the transition went. Both tranches saved me money."

---

### **Who Should NOT Convert?**

**Consider keeping Traditional accounts if:**

1. **Very low expected retirement income** — If you'll be in the 5-15% brackets in retirement, the savings from 10% conversion are smaller  
2. **Near the ARA cap** — If converting would push you well over \$2.5M, excess growth may face penalties  
3. **Need funds before 59½** — Converting requires the 10% tax; early withdrawal from Traditional may be cheaper depending on circumstances  
4. **State tax considerations** — Some states don't tax retirement income; conversion may trigger state tax

---

### **Revenue Impact**

**Assumptions:**

* Total pre-tax retirement assets: \~\$20 trillion  
* Conversion rate: 40-60%  
* Converted assets: \$8-12 trillion

**Revenue:**

* \$8-12T × 10% \= \$800B \- \$1.2T  
* Collected over 10 years \= \$80-120B/year

**Budget Treatment:**

* Years 1-5: Significant revenue boost (front-loaded conversions)  
* Years 6-10: Declining as payment plans complete  
* Years 11+: No conversion revenue, but also no deferred tax liability

---

### **Administrative Details**

**Employer Plans:**

* Employers must offer conversion option to all participants  
* Can convert in-plan or roll to personal ASA  
* Employer match continues to new ASA

**Record Keeping:**

* IRS tracks conversion amounts and payment schedules  
* Taxpayers receive annual statement showing:  
  * Original conversion amount  
  * Remaining payments  
  * ARA balance and lifetime cap status

**Penalties:**

* Missed payments: Standard IRS collection procedures  
* Fraudulent conversion: Standard tax fraud penalties

---

### **Timeline**

| Year | Action |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Bill passes |
| 1-3 | Conversion window open |
| 3 | Window closes for new conversions |
| 4-13 | Payment plans continue |
| 14+ | All conversions complete |

 

**Bottom line:** The Great Conversion is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to move retirement savings into a simpler, tax-free structure at a fraction of normal cost. Most Americans with pre-tax retirement accounts should convert.

## **Appendix E: Account Underutilization Data**

**Retirement Accounts:**

* 54.4% of all families have retirement accounts; 45.6% have none (Federal Reserve, 2022\)  
* Racial disparity: 61.8% white families vs. 34.8% Black families vs. 27.5% Hispanic families  
* Tax incentives are poorly targeted — most subsidies go to high-income taxpayers who would save anyway

**529 Plans:**

* Less than 3% of families use 529 plans or Coverdell accounts  
* 54% of parents are unaware of 529 programs  
* 43% don't use them because they've never heard of them  
* Those who save tend to be at the higher end of income and wealth distributions

**Current complexity:** 15+ account types (401k, 403b, 457, Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Solo 401k, HSA, FSA, 529, Coverdell ESA, ABLE, UGMA, UTMA...). Each has different limits, rules, and tax treatment.

| Country | Top Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Denmark | 55.9% |
| France | 55.4% |
| Austria | 55% |
| Sweden | \~52% |
| **Fair & Simple Tax Act** | **45%** |
| Germany | 47.5% |
| UK | 45% |
| Australia | 45% |
| OECD Average | 42.8% |
| US Current | 37% |

 

### **Capital Gains Rates**

| Country | Top Capital Gains Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Denmark | 42% |
| Norway | 37.8% |
| France | 34% |
| Finland | 34% |
| **Fair & Simple (above \$10M)** | **25%** |
| US Current (long-term) | 23.8% |
| OECD Average | 19.1% |

 

**Effective Rates Under Our Lifetime Exemption:**

| Lifetime Gains | Effective Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Under \$1.5M | 0% |
| \$3M | 7.5% |
| \$10M | 16.3% |
| \$50M | 23.2% |
| \$500M | 24.8% |

 

Most Americans will pay 0% (under the exemption) or 15-20%. Only mega-exits approach the 25% statutory cap.

### **Corporate Tax Rate**

| Country | Corporate Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Germany | 29.9% |
| Japan | 29.7% |
| France | 25% |
| UK | 25% |
| **Fair & Simple Tax Act** | **25%** |
| OECD Average | 23.6% |
| US Current | 21% |

 

### **Estate/Inheritance Tax**

| Country | Top Rate | Exemption |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Japan | 55% | \~\$300K |
| South Korea | 50% | \~\$500K |
| France | 45% | \~\$100K |
| **Fair & Simple Tax Act** | **40%** | **\$5M** |
| UK | 40% | \~\$400K |
| US Current | 40% | \~\$13M |
| Germany | 30% | Varies |

 

Our \$5M exemption remains among the most generous in the developed world.

### **Assessment**

**Income Tax:** Our 45% top rate aligns with UK and Australian peers while maintaining progressive structure. With state taxes, top marginal rates remain under 55% depending on state.

**Capital Gains:** Our \$1.5M lifetime exemption \+ progressive rates (15-32%) are competitive globally. Most Americans pay 0-15%. Only the ultra-wealthy approach rates charged in Nordic countries.

**Corporate:** Our 25% matches UK/France exactly. Above US current law, but middle of OECD pack.

**Estate:** Our 40% rate is standard. Our \$5M exemption is more generous than almost every peer country.

**Bottom line:** Competitive with developed economies. Not punitive, not a tax haven. A system that works.

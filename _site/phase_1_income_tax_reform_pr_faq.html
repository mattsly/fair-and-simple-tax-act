<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

<p><strong>The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act Simplifies the Tax Code, Closes Loopholes, and Makes the System Work Better for Ordinary Americans</strong></p>

<p>Today, the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act (FSTA) is introduced as a focused reform of personal income and capital taxation. The Act modernizes the U.S. tax code by eliminating unnecessary complexity, closing long-standing loopholes, and creating a system that is easier to understand, harder to game, and more fiscally durable over time. The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act raises $200-310 billion annually by closing loopholes and broadening the tax base—without raising rates on ordinary income, closing 15-25% of the federal deficit gap while making the system simpler and fairer for working families.</p>

<p>Over decades, the tax code has accumulated layer upon layer of special rules, carve-outs, and parallel systems. While many of these provisions were created with good intentions, the result is a system that is difficult for taxpayers to understand, costly to comply with, and increasingly disconnected from its stated goals. Filing taxes has become unpredictable for ordinary households and arbitrage-driven for those with access to sophisticated planning.</p>

<p>The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act addresses this problem by simplifying the structure of personal taxation and broadening the tax base rather than relying on narrow fixes or symbolic changes. It removes overlapping systems like the Alternative Minimum Tax and the Net Investment Income Tax, replaces a patchwork of deductions and credits with simpler, more transparent mechanisms, and reforms capital gains taxation to better reflect lifetime outcomes rather than one-off transactions.</p>

<p>For most working families, this means a tax system that is more predictable and easier to navigate, with fewer hidden penalties and fewer incentives for financial engineering. The Act includes a straightforward, refundable child benefit that supports families building economic security, while avoiding sharp cliffs or complex eligibility rules.</p>

<p>For entrepreneurs and investors, the proposal preserves strong incentives to start companies, take risks, and invest for the long term, while reducing opportunities to reclassify income or defer taxes indefinitely. Capital gains remain taxed on realization, not on paper, but are treated more consistently across a lifetime, closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit a small number of very high-income households.</p>

<p>The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act is designed to be fiscally responsible. By broadening the base and simplifying the rules, it raises revenue in a more stable and predictable way, reducing reliance on temporary patches and narrow surtaxes. The proposal is revenue-positive from day one and contributes to a more credible path toward long-term budget sustainability.
This Act is intentionally focused in scope. It addresses personal income and capital taxation and does not attempt to resolve every major fiscal challenge in a single step.</p>

<p>The goal of the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act is not to make the tax code perfect, but to make it legible, coherent, and honest about tradeoffs. By simplifying the system and aligning incentives with productive economic activity, the proposal aims to create a tax code that better serves taxpayers, policymakers, and the long-term health of the country.</p>
<h2 id="tenets">Tenets</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Radical Simplicity:</strong> The tax code should be clearly explainable and ideally automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, reduces economic deadweight loss, and limits loopholes (raising revenue). Every tax paying American should have a strong understanding of how the tax code works and what the key levers are. With a more broadly understood tax code with a smaller number key levers, we enable more meaningful public debate about our tradeoffs and priorities. By reducing the tax code to a few transparent levers, we shift the power from specialists back to citizens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit):</strong> The tax code and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security. It should not reward financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiscal Durability:</strong> The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic changes. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. An adequately durable systems will reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls. We aim to be agnostic about revenues versus costs and prioritize the most effective path to fiscal health while codifying core American values.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-the-big-picture"><strong>Part 1: The Big Picture</strong></h2>

<h2 id="q1-what-problem-does-this-solve"><strong>Q1: What problem does this solve?</strong></h2>

<p>The current personal tax system is complex, unpredictable, and increasingly gameable. It burdens ordinary filers with a maze of overlapping rules while leaving large gaps that sophisticated planning can exploit, especially for investment income and very high-wealth households. It also relies on narrow, temporary fixes rather than a stable base, making long-term fiscal planning harder.</p>

<p>This phase addresses those problems by simplifying the structure, closing the biggest avoidance channels, and making the revenue base more durable. That keeps debate focused on outcomes and calibration, not preserving a system that cannot be clearly understood, modeled, or tuned.</p>

<h2 id="q2-what-does-the-fair--simple-tax-act-actually-change"><strong>Q2: What does the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act actually change?</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: How to Read the Specific Numbers in This Proposal</em></p>

  <p>This proposal is primarily about structural reform, not locking in precise tax rates. The income and lifetime capital gains brackets shown below are initial calibrations meant to prove the system can work and to anchor the fiscal targets; they are not final numbers, but they are based on real estimates. Reasonable people can disagree on exact rates and cutoffs, yet any revisions must still meet the revenue and durability goals in Tenet 3. The intent is to make the levers transparent and modelable so debate stays focused on outcomes and calibration rather than defending a system that cannot be clearly understood, modeled, or tuned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For most taxpayers, filing stays familiar but becomes fairer and simpler, while the largest loopholes used by ultra-wealthy families are closed.</p>

<h2 id="q3-how-far-does-this-go-toward-a-responsible-federal-budget"><strong>Q3: How far does this go toward a responsible federal budget?</strong></h2>

<p>For taxpayers, this means no broad tax increase and an immediate deficit impact; the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act is <strong>revenue-positive from Day 1</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners: +$40–60B annually</li>
  <li>Closing stepped-up basis loophole (death = realization event): +$75-100B annually</li>
  <li>Closing buy-borrow-die and other avoidance strategies: +$25-50B annually</li>
  <li>Estate tax reform (lower exemption, broader base): +$50-65B annually</li>
  <li>Progressive capital gains rates above the $1.5M allowance: +$50–80B annually</li>
  <li>QSBS elimination (universal $1.5M allowance instead): +$10-20B annually</li>
  <li>ROTH mega-account reforms (contribution freeze + death taxation of gains): +$15-25B annually</li>
  <li><strong>Total: $240–350B in new annual revenue</strong> (interaction-adjusted)</li>
</ul>

<p>These gains cover the costs (~$30–40B for AMT/NIIT elimination) and include the child benefit consolidation savings, resulting in <strong>$200-310B net annual revenue</strong>.</p>

<p>This closes roughly 15-25% of the deficit gap. The remainder requires additional revenue measures and spending reforms; see the <a href="/#fiscal-sustainability-summary">Fiscal Sustainability Summary</a> in the Project Overview.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Act is fiscally responsible and revenue-positive, but long-term balance requires parallel tax and spending discipline.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-core-mechanics"><strong>Part 2: Core Mechanics</strong></h2>

<h2 id="q4-how-much-simpler-is-this-really"><strong>Q4: How much simpler is this really?</strong></h2>

<p>The current system’s complexity is a feature for those who can exploit it. FSTA simplifies the code by replacing narrow carve-outs with universal rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stepped-up basis at death</strong>  -  The $300B+ loophole letting appreciated assets pass tax-free across generations</li>
  <li><strong>Buy-borrow-die</strong>  -  Living off asset-backed loans to avoid ever selling (and ever paying tax)</li>
  <li><strong>Carried interest</strong>  -  Reclassifying labor income as capital gains (closed structurally via 45% convergence)</li>
  <li><strong>QSBS carve-outs</strong>  -  Sector-specific preferential treatment that creates distortions</li>
  <li><strong>Backdoor ROTH and mega-ROTH sheltering</strong>  -  Workarounds that let the wealthy shelter billions tax-free</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</strong>  -  A parallel tax system that adds complexity without solving the underlying problem</li>
  <li><strong>Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)</strong>  -  Another layered system that complicates rather than clarifies</li>
</ul>

<p>FSTA replaces this with clear, universal rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eight income brackets (adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners)</li>
  <li>One <strong>Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance</strong> ($1.5M per person)</li>
  <li>Death = realization event (no basis step-up)</li>
  <li>Progressive capital gains convergence at $100M+ (45%, matching the ordinary income rate)</li>
</ul>

<p>For typical filers, nothing changes structurally - you still file once a year with standard forms. But the system stops rewarding financial engineering and starts rewarding genuine value creation.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="q5-who-benefits-and-who-pays-more"><strong>Q5: Who benefits and who pays more?</strong></h2>

<p>For most families, taxes go down or stay flat; the increases are concentrated at the very top.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Working and middle-class families:</strong> pay less</li>
  <li><strong>Upper-middle-class families below the phase-out ceiling:</strong> protected from increases</li>
  <li><strong>Extreme wealth:</strong> pays more, through broader bases and higher top-end rates</li>
  <li><strong>Everyone:</strong> saves time and money on compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Income tax brackets match current law (no change for most workers)</li>
  <li>Families with children benefit from the $4K/child credit</li>
  <li>Capital gains below the Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance are tax-free (replaces the primary residence exclusion), progressive rates above that (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%)</li>
  <li>Very large incomes ($1.5M+) and very large fortunes contribute more through the new 45% bracket</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In plain terms:</strong><br />
A nurse or teacher with kids saves money through the child benefit. A small business owner with capital gains under the lifetime allowance pays nothing on those gains. A nine-figure fortune pays more.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="q6-how-do-the-new-income-tax-brackets-work"><strong>Q6: How do the new income tax brackets work?</strong></h2>

<p>For most earners, brackets stay essentially the same and filing is simpler because AMT/NIIT disappear; only very high earners see a new 45% bracket.</p>

<h2 id="q7-how-are-capital-gains-dividends-and-investment-income-taxed"><strong>Q7: How are capital gains, dividends, and investment income taxed?</strong></h2>

<p>For all investors, the first $1.5M of lifetime gains are tax-free under the <strong>Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance</strong> ($3M married filing jointly) and long-term holdings are still rewarded. FSTA sets capital gains rates by <strong>Cumulative Lifetime Capital Gains</strong> — the running total of realized gains — to ensure extreme wealth does not pay lower rates than labor. <strong>At $100M+ in lifetime gains, capital gains rates converge with ordinary income (45%).</strong></p>

<p>Key rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thresholds are shown for single filers; married filing jointly doubles the allowance and brackets.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If the allowance is adjusted in the future, changes apply prospectively: increases add headroom for everyone; decreases apply only to gains realized after the change (no retroactive clawback). Bracket thresholds are expected to be indexed to inflation over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assets must be held <strong>more than one year</strong> to qualify</li>
  <li>Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income</li>
  <li>The allowance is <strong>$1.5M per person</strong> (married couples can combine for <strong>$3M</strong>)</li>
  <li>The allowance is a <strong>lifetime cumulative</strong> 0% bucket that can be used across multiple sales until the $1.5M cap is reached</li>
  <li><strong>Cumulative Lifetime Capital Gains</strong> tracking starts at enactment; only post-enactment gains count</li>
</ul>

<p>The allowance is indexed to inflation. Capital losses can offset gains but do not replenish the allowance. The allowance is per individual and becomes portable prospectively upon marriage; it does not retroactively pool pre-marriage gains.</p>

<p>This structure protects ordinary wealth-building while ensuring very large gains contribute more.</p>

<p>For the most part, there are no changes to how capital losses, interest and dividends are taxed</p>

<h3 id="capital-losses"><strong>Capital Losses</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Capital losses offset capital gains without limit (same as current law)</li>
  <li>Up to $3,000/year can offset ordinary income (same as current law)</li>
  <li>Unused losses carry forward indefinitely (same as current law)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dividends-investment-yield"><strong>Dividends (Investment Yield)</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Qualified dividends</strong>  -  Taxed at the capital gains rate determined by lifetime gains, with a <strong>15% minimum</strong>; dividends do <strong>not</strong> consume the allowance</li>
  <li><strong>Ordinary dividends</strong>  -  Taxed as ordinary income (same as current law)</li>
  <li>Dividends do NOT count toward the $1.5M allowance  -  the allowance is reserved for capital appreciation only</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interest-income--foreign-investments"><strong>Interest Income &amp; Foreign Investments</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Municipal bond interest  -  Tax-exempt (unchanged)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="q8-how-are-brackets-calibrated-over-time"><strong>Q8: How are brackets calibrated over time?</strong></h2>

<p>These principles apply to both <strong>income tax brackets</strong> and <strong>lifetime capital gains brackets</strong>. The brackets shown here are initial calibrations. Phase 1 is focused on locking in structure, not final rates, and reasonable disagreement on exact bracket levels is expected. The system is intentionally designed to allow iteration without reopening core structural decisions over time, with wealth disparity treated as a primary calibration input.</p>

<p>Today’s tax code contains too many hidden levers to model or tune coherently. This proposal intentionally limits the number of policy knobs so modeling, feedback, and adjustment are clearer over time. Simplicity is a governance advantage, not just a usability improvement.</p>

<p>Bracket calibration may be adjusted over time based on a small set of explicit indicators, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wealth disparity:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Concentration of wealth at the top</li>
      <li>Growth of median net worth relative to top deciles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Economic performance:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Real GDP growth</li>
      <li>Median wage growth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fiscal sustainability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Debt-to-GDP trajectory</li>
      <li>Long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare (post-Phase 2)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Behavioral signals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Capital gains realization patterns</li>
      <li>Labor participation at high income levels</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 2 Social Security reform will inform future bracket calibration, and final tuning should consider the full tax and benefit system.</p>

<p>Structural elements are intentionally hard to change. Rates and thresholds should be reviewed periodically. Adjustments should be incremental and transparent. The objective is long-term system stability rather than short-term optimization.</p>

<p>This is a simple universal benefit that <strong>replaces the CTC, EITC, and Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)</strong> with a predictable $4,000-per-child benefit and automatic delivery, with no work tests or cliffs.</p>

<h3 id="core-structure"><strong>Core structure</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>$4,000 per child per year</strong>, <strong>up to 3 children per household</strong></li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Ends at fixed income levels:</strong> $500K married / $300K single</li>
  <li><strong>Linear, smooth phase-out</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase-out formula (for 1–3 kids):</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Default:</strong> credit goes to the custodial parent (more nights)</li>
  <li><strong>50/50 custody:</strong> parents may <strong>elect to split</strong> the credit for that child (e.g., 50/50)</li>
  <li><strong>If no agreement:</strong> one claimant per child per year, resolved by a simple tie‑breaker (e.g., higher AGI or prior‑year claimant)</li>
  <li><strong>No double‑counting:</strong> a child counts once toward the 3‑child cap per household</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Budget impact (illustrative):</strong> Current combined spending is <strong>~$270–280B/year</strong> (CTC + EITC + CDCC). The proposed unified benefit is <strong>~$220B/year</strong>, for <strong>~$50–60B/year</strong> in net savings.</p>

<p><em>Note: Budget figures are illustrative ranges based on public aggregates; final calibration is a legislative choice.</em></p>

<p>This removes benefit cliffs, treats stay-at-home and working parents equally, and makes support predictable. Distributional impacts are detailed in <a href="#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="q10-what-are-the-roth-account-reforms-and-why-close-the-peter-thiel-loophole"><strong>Q10: What are the ROTH account reforms, and why close the “Peter Thiel loophole”?</strong></h2>

<p>For savers, this means broader access to ROTHs and clear limits, while mega-account abuse is closed. The Act makes four changes to ROTH IRAs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Remove income limits</strong> for direct ROTH contributions (ends backdoor conversions).</li>
  <li><strong>Raise the annual cap</strong> to $15K (indexed).</li>
  <li><strong>Freeze new contributions</strong> once the balance reaches $2.5M; investment growth can continue.</li>
  <li><strong>Tax ROTH gains at death</strong> as capital gains using the remaining allowance; contributions remain untaxed, with a 15-year payment option for illiquid estates.</li>
</ol>

<p>These reforms close the “Peter Thiel” mega-ROTH loophole while protecting ordinary savers. <strong>Revenue: $15–25B annually.</strong>
There are <strong>no changes</strong> to Traditional 401(k)s, Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs.</p>

<h2 id="q11-how-does-the-act-close-the-buy-borrow-die-loophole"><strong>Q11: How does the Act close the ‘buy, borrow, die’ loophole?</strong></h2>

<p>For most taxpayers, ordinary borrowing is unchanged; the only impact is on ultra-wealthy strategies that live tax-free on loans. Buy-borrow-die lets ultra-wealthy households borrow against appreciated assets, live on loans, and erase gains at death via stepped-up basis. FSTA closes the loop with a deemed-sale rule for asset-backed borrowing and by ending stepped-up basis.</p>

<p><strong>New rule (asset-backed borrowing):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a loan is secured by appreciated assets and the loan exceeds cost basis, the excess triggers taxable gain</li>
  <li>Tax applies to appreciation only; basis steps up by the borrowed amount to avoid double taxation</li>
  <li>Illiquid assets get payment flexibility (same 15-year option)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Safety valve:</strong> A “deemed sale” only only triggers once the loan amount (combined with previous gains) exceeds the $1.5M exceeds your remaining <strong>Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What is not affected:</strong> ordinary business loans, mortgages, and borrowing for reinvestment or expansion. The rule targets personal-consumption borrowing against appreciated collateral, using lender-reported loan purpose and existing enforcement doctrines.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> You can still borrow, but you cannot live tax-free on appreciation and wipe the gain at death.</p>

<p>Case study: <a href="#7-billionaire-borrower--100m-stock-5m-year-loan">Billionaire Borrower</a>.</p>

<h2 id="q12-what-happens-when-someone-dies"><strong>Q12: What happens when someone dies?</strong></h2>

<p>For most families, nothing is owed at death and heirs receive a clean basis; only large unrealized gains face tax. Under the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act, <strong>basis step-up is eliminated</strong> and death becomes the final realization event (the <strong>Final Sync</strong>)  -  unrealized capital gains are taxed on the final return using the same lifetime capital gains system, and heirs receive a clean basis at the value at death.</p>

<p><strong>How the allowance applies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Remaining lifetime allowance shields unrealized gains first</li>
  <li>Gains above that are taxed at the progressive capital gains rates (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example (typical estate):</strong> $400K in unrealized gains with an unused $1.5M allowance → <strong>$0</strong> tax.</p>

<p><strong>Illiquid assets:</strong> 15-year payment option at low interest to avoid forced sales of farms, businesses, or real estate.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Most families owe nothing; large fortunes pay deferred tax and heirs start with a clean basis.</p>

<h2 id="q13-how-does-this-close-estate-planning-loopholes-like-grats-dynasty-trusts-and-valuation-discounts"><strong>Q13: How does this close estate planning loopholes like GRATs, dynasty trusts, and valuation discounts?</strong></h2>

<p>For typical families, legitimate estate planning still works; the change is that appreciation can’t escape tax forever. The Act eliminates the underlying conditions that make these techniques work  -  without banning each vehicle. GRATs, dynasty trusts, valuation discounts, and similar tools rely on indefinite deferral, stepped-up basis at death, and high estate exemptions.</p>

<p><strong>FSTA changes the foundation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Death is a realization event; no stepped-up basis</li>
  <li>Estate exemption lowered to $5M per person ($10M couples)</li>
  <li>Progressive lifetime gains rates apply to large estates</li>
  <li>Trust income is taxed annually at the top rate; no exemption stacking</li>
  <li>15-year payment option protects illiquid family businesses and farms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Trusts and planning tools can still be used for governance and protection, but appreciation cannot escape taxation indefinitely.</p>

<h2 id="q14-how-do-trusts-work-under-this-plan-can-i-use-them-to-avoid-paying-tax-forever"><strong>Q14: How do trusts work under this plan? Can I use them to avoid paying tax forever?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> For families using trusts, you can still protect assets and manage distributions, but you cannot use trusts for permanent tax deferral.</p>

<p><strong>How trusts are taxed:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retained income/gains:</strong> Trust pays <strong>45%</strong> in the year earned</li>
  <li><strong>Distributions:</strong> Beneficiaries pay ordinary income tax or capital gains tax using their lifetime allowance</li>
  <li><strong>Allowance is per person:</strong> Trusts do not get their own $1.5M allowance and cannot stack allowances across generations</li>
</ul>

<p>Trusts remain useful for governance, creditor protection, and controlled distributions  -  not for avoiding tax forever.</p>

<h1 id="part-4-impact-on-innovation--investment">Part 4: Impact on Innovation &amp; Investment</h1>

<h2 id="q15-doesnt-eliminating-the-primary-residence-exclusion-hurt-homeowners"><strong>Q15: Doesn’t eliminating the primary residence exclusion hurt homeowners?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> For most homeowners, nothing changes in practice  -  the $1.5M Lifetime Capital Gains Allowance covers typical home-sale gains and treats housing the same as other long-term saving.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Buy at $250K, sell at $650K → $400K gain, <strong>$0 tax</strong>. You still have $1.1M of lifetime allowance left for future gains.</p>

<p>The allowance is designed to cover multiple moves over a lifetime; most households never reach $1.5M in total housing gains.</p>

<p><strong>Why replace the current exclusion?</strong> The current rule privileges homeowners, encourages tax-driven housing decisions, and requires ownership/use tests. A single lifetime allowance is simpler and neutral across homes, stocks, and businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Most home sales remain tax-free, with fewer special rules and fairer treatment across asset types.</p>

<h2 id="q16-why-no-special-carried-interest-rule"><strong>Q16: Why no special carried interest rule?</strong></h2>

<p>For most funds and investors, there’s no new special rule to track; carried interest is neutralized automatically. At $100M+ in lifetime capital gains, the rate converges to 45%  -  the same as the top ordinary income rate  -  so re-labeling labor income as capital gains no longer helps.</p>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Applies automatically across private equity, hedge funds, venture, and real estate</li>
  <li>No bespoke rules or carve-outs; IRS applies the lifetime gains schedule</li>
  <li>Limited partners are unchanged; this targets managers’ profit share</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> $200M in lifetime carry → gains above $100M taxed at 45%, yielding an effective rate in the low 40s%.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Carried interest is closed by design, not by creating a new carve-out.</p>

<h2 id="q17-will-this-punish-entrepreneurs-and-innovators"><strong>Q17: Will this punish entrepreneurs and innovators?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> For founders, long-term gains are still rewarded and the $1.5M lifetime allowance applies broadly. FSTA keeps long-term capital gains treatment, adds a $1.5M lifetime allowance, and taxes short-term trading as ordinary income. It replaces QSBS with a <strong>universal allowance</strong> that applies to all founders, regardless of entity type or industry.</p>

<p>Some large exits that currently qualify for QSBS will pay more, but the system is broader, simpler, and more predictable. Case studies are in <a href="#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The Act rewards patient capital and innovation while eliminating narrow carve-outs that only some founders can access.</p>

<h2 id="q18-what-about-expatriation-and-capital-flight"><strong>Q18: What about expatriation and capital flight?</strong></h2>

<p>For almost everyone, this doesn’t apply; for those who expatriate, gains are taxed as if sold. <strong>Renouncing citizenship triggers the same rule as death: a mark-to-market tax on all gains, with the lifetime allowance and progressive capital gains rates.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-the-exit-tax-works"><strong>How the exit tax works</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>All appreciated assets are marked to market on the departure date; remaining lifetime allowance applies first.</li>
  <li>Gains above the allowance are taxed at 15%/20%/27%/32% based on total lifetime gains.</li>
  <li>Illiquid assets get 15-year payment flexibility to avoid forced sales.</li>
  <li>Covered expatriate rules continue to apply; returns within 10 years can trigger collection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enforcement-and-leakage-controls"><strong>Enforcement and leakage controls</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Uses existing reporting (FATCA/FBAR), beneficial ownership rules, and bank reporting on large transfers.</li>
  <li>Departure bonds and treaty information-sharing can be required for high-net-worth departures.</li>
  <li>Proceeds are hard to hide if they are ever moved into the formal financial system or used in developed markets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scale-of-the-risk"><strong>Scale of the risk</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A few thousand people renounce annually; only a minority are tax-motivated and fewer still can successfully hide proceeds long term.</li>
  <li>Even with some evasion, the leakage is small relative to the revenue recovered from closing other loopholes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Departure is taxed as if assets were sold. Payment relief prevents fire sales, existing reporting makes evasion difficult, and the fiscal risk is limited.</p>

<h2 id="q19-why-not-just-impose-a-wealth-tax"><strong>Q19: Why not just impose a wealth tax?</strong></h2>

<p>For taxpayers, this approach avoids annual asset valuations while still capturing extreme wealth. Wealth taxes have failed in most countries that tried them. France, Sweden, Austria, and others repealed their wealth taxes after discovering:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valuation challenges:</strong> How do you annually value private companies, real estate, art, and other illiquid assets? Disputes are endless and expensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital flight:</strong> France lost an estimated 42,000 millionaires over 12 years before repealing its wealth tax in 2017. The revenue loss from departures exceeded the tax collected.</li>
  <li><strong>Enforcement costs:</strong> Administrative costs often approached or exceeded revenue, making the tax fiscally counterproductive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Fair &amp; Simple Tax Act achieves similar progressivity through realization events, including sales, death, borrowing, and expatriation, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Easier to value:</strong> Transaction prices and market values at specific moments, not annual appraisals.</li>
  <li><strong>Harder to evade:</strong> Documented transactions with third-party reporting.</li>
  <li><strong>More enforceable:</strong> Uses existing IRS infrastructure for capital gains rather than creating new valuation bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>By taxing gains at realization with progressive rates (0% to 45%), eliminating stepped-up basis at death, and closing buy-borrow-die, we capture wealth accumulation without the administrative burden of annual valuations.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This approach is more durable, more enforceable, and learns from the failures of wealth taxes in other countries.</p>

<h2 id="q20-what-is-not-included-in-this-act"><strong>Q20: What is not included in this Act?</strong></h2>

<p>For taxpayers, this means the plan stays focused on personal taxation to maximize clarity, feasibility, and administrative simplicity. As a result:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No corporate tax changes.</strong> Those are outside this Act’s scope.</li>
  <li><strong>No new broad‑based taxes</strong> (e.g., VAT or national sales taxes).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Focus now is loophole closure and simplification; broader tax architecture changes are outside this Act’s scope.</p>

<h2 id="q21-why-now"><strong>Q21: Why now?</strong></h2>

<p>For taxpayers, the timing finally supports real simplification. The code has hit a complexity ceiling, parallel systems (AMT, NIIT, deductions, carve‑outs) have become unmanageable, and public trust is eroding in a system that feels arbitrary and gamed. At the same time, automation and pre‑filled returns are now technically feasible  -  but only if the underlying rules are simplified. This proposal focuses on the foundation first: reduce complexity, close obvious gaps, and create a clearer base for future reforms.</p>

<h2 id="q22-does-this-act-address-social-security-or-payroll-taxes"><strong>Q22: Does this Act address Social Security or payroll taxes?</strong></h2>

<p>No. This Act focuses narrowly on simplifying personal income and capital taxation. Social Security and payroll taxes raise distinct questions about demographics, benefits, and long-term solvency, and deserve a dedicated treatment. A follow-on proposal will address Social Security directly using the same tenets.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue"><strong>Epilogue</strong></h2>

<p>This Act is designed to stand on its own. It is also intended as one part of the Fair &amp; Simple Tax Project, a broader effort to modernize the tax system over time. Future work may address payroll taxes and Social Security with the same emphasis on simplicity, fairness, and fiscal durability.</p>

<p><em>Note: Current effective rates include FICA, federal income tax, and account for common deductions/loopholes. Fair &amp; Simple rates include income tax with no loopholes.</em></p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Bottom 80% pay less or about the same, driven primarily by the $4K/child benefit.</li>
  <li>Upper-middle incomes are mostly flat; top earners pay more via the 45% bracket and loophole closures.</li>
  <li>The top 0.01% sees the largest increase, which funds most of the net revenue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> FSTA improves fairness and fiscal durability while simplifying compliance.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Under current law, borrowing against appreciated assets produces no taxable event. Under FSTA, the <strong>deemed-sale rule</strong> treats the borrowed amount as realized gain once the allowance is exhausted, so borrowing to fund consumption triggers tax at the top capital gains rate. Basis steps up by the borrowed amount to prevent double taxation on eventual sale.

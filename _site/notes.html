      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">The Fair & Simple Tax Act</a></h1>
      

      <p>A few strong data points to consider adding:</p>

<p><strong>Tax Compliance Confidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS data shows ~40% of filers use professional tax prep services (H&amp;R Block, tax attorneys, CPAs)</li>
  <li>Survey data: Only ~30% of Americans say they “fully understand” their tax obligations</li>
  <li>Gallup/AARP polls show majority of Americans find tax code “too complicated”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time Burden:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS estimates 7.1 billion hours annually on tax compliance (you cite this)</li>
  <li>That’s roughly 21 hours per household per year</li>
  <li>Adds up to ~$213B in economic value lost to compliance alone</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tax Gap:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS reports $600B+ annual “tax gap” (taxes owed but uncollected)</li>
  <li>Higher on capital gains and business income due to complexity</li>
  <li>Simplification directly improves collection rates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Error Rates:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS audit data shows higher error rates on itemized deductions and complex credits</li>
  <li>EITC error rate ~24% (overpayment or underpayment)</li>
  <li>Simplification reduces these administrative errors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Sources to Cite:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS Data Book (annual, public)</li>
  <li>Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances</li>
  <li>Brookings Institution reports on tax compliance</li>
  <li>Tax Foundation studies on compliance burden</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d recommend adding a sentence or two around <strong>line 3-4</strong> of the press release noting: <em>“[X]% of Americans lack confidence in their tax filing, and the average household spends 21 hours annually on compliance.”</em> This sets emotional stakes before launching into policy.</p>

<h3 id="q19-passthrough-draft-15-annual-capital-return--condensed-summary">Q19 passthrough draft (15% annual capital return) — condensed summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Proposed a 15% annual capital-return allowance (up to 10 years) on documented owner capital; excess profit taxed as ordinary income; capital-return amounts counted against the $1.5M lifetime exemption; capital gains at exit still available.</li>
  <li>Goal: end S-corp wage/distribution arbitrage, curb carried-interest treatment, and reward documented risk-taking; S-corp vs LLC choice becomes tax-neutral.</li>
  <li>Examples showed ~31% effective rates on $500K profit with $200K invested; modest revenue gain from closing arbitrage (~$15–25B net after allowing the preference).</li>
  <li>Mechanics: salary optimization becomes irrelevant; allowance expires after 10 years; “use it or lose it” each year; lifetime exemption brake limits double-dipping.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-we-didnt-adopt-the-15-capital-return-approach">Why we didn’t adopt the 15% capital-return approach</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Complexity vs. simplicity goal:</strong> Annual capital-base tracking, documentation tests, and 10-year timers add moving parts; harder to message than a salary floor plus a single residual allowance percentage.</li>
  <li><strong>Audit/gaming risk:</strong> Fair-market-value disputes on contributed property; timing games on capital infusions; pressure to inflate basis to grow the 15% benefit.</li>
  <li><strong>Uneven by business type:</strong> Capital-heavy firms benefit more than sweat-heavy firms; we want a uniform rule for founders, professionals, and small services.</li>
  <li><strong>Overlap with lifetime exemption:</strong> Annual capital-return amounts already consume the exemption, but still invite double counting debates and recordkeeping friction.</li>
  <li><strong>Fiscal uncertainty:</strong> Revenue swing depends on capital-basis assertions; harder to bound than a flat residual percentage with a salary floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Cleaner alternative chosen:</strong> The $120K compensation floor + 20% residual sweat-equity allowance (counting against the lifetime exemption) gives parity or better outcomes with fewer calculations and clearer guardrails.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phases:</p>

<p>PHASE 1: “The Billionaire Loophole Closure Act” (2025-2026)
What’s in it:</p>

<p>Buy-borrow-die closure (asset-backed borrowing triggers deemed realization)
Simplified income tax brackets (6 brackets: 4%, 12%, 23%, 36%, 39%, 45%)
Stepped-up basis elimination (phased: $50M+ estates first 3 years, $20M+ next 3 years, then universal)
AMT/NIIT elimination + progressive lifetime capital gains rates (0% → 15% → 20% → 27% → 32%)
$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption (replaces $500K home exclusion with universal exemption)
Pass-through &amp; Carrieed Interest reform: $120K salary minimum + 50% of profits above salary at cap gains (counts toward exemption) + 50% ordinary income with SE tax
Universal $6,000/child benefit (consolidates CTC, EITC, childcare credits)</p>

<p>Revenue: $150-250B annually (when fully phased)
Political sell: “Close loopholes that only benefit ultra-wealthy, simplify taxes for everyone else by eliminating AMT/NIIT, and give every American a $1.5M lifetime exemption for building wealth.”
Feasibility: HIGH - Pure loophole closure + simplification sweetener</p>

<p>PHASE 2: “The Social Security Solvency Act” (2027-2028)
What’s in it:</p>

<p>Eliminate Social Security wage cap (6.2% on all wages, no ceiling)
Reduce self-employment tax 15.3% → 12%
Minor benefit reforms (means-test top 5%, raise retirement age 2 months for those under 50)</p>

<p>Revenue: $150-200B annually
Political sell: “Social Security trust fund depletes in 2033. This fixes it for 75+ years without cutting benefits for 95% of Americans. High earners finally contribute on all income. Small business owners get a tax cut.”
Feasibility: MEDIUM-HIGH - Crisis creates urgency as 2033 approaches</p>

<p>PHASE 3: “The Universal Savings &amp; Family Security Act” (2029-2030)
What’s in it:
American Savings Account (ASA) - one account replaces 15+ types
Optional 12% conversion from legacy 401(k)/IRA (10-year window)</p>

<p>Revenue/Cost: Roughly neutral ($50-100B net cost)</p>

<p>ASA conversion generates one-time windfall ($1.2-1.3T over 10 years)</p>

<p>Political sell: “One retirement account instead of 15. One child benefit instead of three. Six simple brackets. Optional conversion at bargain 12% rate. This is what simplification actually looks like.”
Feasibility: MEDIUM - Easier after Phases 1-2 build trust</p>

<p>PHASE 4: “The Final Simplification” (2031+)
What’s in it:</p>

<p>Eliminate mortgage interest deduction (standard deduction already higher)
SALT → universal 10% credit (automatic, capped at $10K)
Charitable deduction → 30% universal credit (capped at 25% of tax liability)
Student loan interest, energy credits, home office → direct programs (outside tax code)</p>

<p>Revenue: $100-150B annually
Political sell: “No more hidden subsidies. Same treatment for everyone. If government wants to subsidize something, do it openly through direct programs - not buried in tax forms.”
Feasibility: LOW-MEDIUM - Hardest phase, only works after 1-3 succeed</p>

<p>Why This Sequencing:</p>

<p>Phase 1 = Easy win (villains are billionaires, benefits are universal)
Phase 2 = Crisis-driven (SS depletion focuses minds)
Phase 3 = Rewards for trust (tangible benefits after proving you can execute)
Phase 4 = Cleanup (final distortions, only possible if 1-3 worked)</p>

<p>Total when fully implemented: $400-600B in annual deficit reduction</p>

<h3 id="old-index-page">Old Index PAge</h3>

<p>The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a proposal to “refactor” U.S. fiscal policy.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p>The U.S. tax system raises revenue in ways that are opaque, uneven, and increasingly disconnected from how Americans actually earn money and build wealth. It punishes work more reliably than wealth, rewards financial engineering over productive activity, and requires an entire parallel industry just to navigate it. The result is a system that is widely resented, poorly understood, and politically brittle.</p>

<p>At the same time, we are heading into a decade defined by two unavoidable realities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An aging population that will put sustained pressure on Social Security and Medicare</li>
  <li>A labor market that looks nothing like the one the tax code was designed for</li>
</ol>

<p>Layering new credits on top of old deductions, or carving out yet another exception, only deepens the problem. Complexity itself has become a form of unfairness.</p>

<p>This proposal starts from a different premise:</p>

<p>If the tax code were simple, durable, and legible to ordinary citizens, many downstream problems would become easier to solve.</p>

<p>The policy design is based on three fundamental tenets (see below). These tenets will be referenced throughout, and are included in each independant proposal.</p>

<p>Phase 1 modernizes how we tax income and capital so that work, saving, and entrepreneurship are treated consistently and transparently.</p>

<p>Phase 2 strengthens Social Security by broadening its funding base in a way that reflects today’s economy, without cutting benefits for typical workers.</p>

<p>The goal is not to “win” a partisan argument or to optimize for a single constituency. It’s to build a tax system that can plausibly last: one that people can understand, comply with, and debate honestly.</p>

<p>A tax system that no one trusts cannot sustain a democratic society for long. This is an attempt to rebuild that trust, starting with the fundamentals.</p>

<h3 id="why-im-doing-this">Why I’m Doing This</h3>

<p>I’ve paid taxes as a student, a teacher, a W-2 employee, a startup employee, a founder, an executive, and an investor. I’ve filed as single and married, with and without kids. I’ve done my taxes by hand, used consumer software, hired professionals, filed extensions, and dealt with edge cases that only show up once you’ve lived in the system for a long time. None of this makes me special, but it does give me a wide, practical view of how the tax code actually behaves in the real world.</p>

<p>What stands out is not that taxes are too high or too low. It’s that the system is far more complex than it needs to be, in ways that actively distort behavior and undermine trust.</p>

<p>I’m a systems thinker by training and by instinct. I’ve spent my career designing and maintaining software systems, and one lesson carries across domains: complexity is not neutral. Every extra rule, exception, and workaround increases failure modes, shifts power to intermediaries, and makes honest reasoning harder. When a system becomes too complex to explain clearly, it stops being governable. The tax code now feels like a software system that has never been refactored, only patched.</p>

<p>I’m also an experienced product leader. Whether we like it or not, we are all customers of our government, and the tax code is how most of us interact with it most directly. For many households, taxes are the single largest “purchase” they make each year. Yet the experience is opaque, stressful, and often dependent on professional help. In any other domain, we would call that a design failure. A well-designed tax system should feel more like a simple checkout flow than a legal obstacle course. That means thinking explicitly about different user personas, defaults, automation, and clarity, not just statutory intent.</p>

<p>I sold a company a few years ago and now have time to work on problems that sit at the intersection of systems, numbers, and fairness. This is exactly that kind of problem. I’m not approaching it as an academic exercise or a campaign platform, but as a design challenge: how do we build a tax system that is simpler, more legible, and more durable over time?</p>

<p>Finally, I’m doing this as an American citizen and a parent. I’m concerned about the long-term fiscal health of the country my kids will inherit, and about a political environment that makes sensible reform feel impossible. I believe we need to find a middle ground that protects and rewards innovation and work, while also acknowledging the systemic risks of extreme and growing wealth inequality.</p>

<p>This proposal is an attempt to bring a fresh perspective, without a political agenda, to a system that desperately needs one.</p>

<h2 id="tenets">Tenets</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Radical Simplicity:</strong> The tax code should be clearly explainable and, where possible, automated. If a provision cannot be understood without specialists, it does not belong. Simplicity reduces compliance costs, economic deadweight loss, and loopholes, while enabling more meaningful public debate about tradeoffs and priorities through a smaller set of transparent levers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit):</strong> The tax and entitlement system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and families building economic security, not financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched privilege. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking or perpetual avoidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiscal Durability:</strong> The system must be fiscally responsible across economic cycles and demographic changes. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and adjustable parameters that do not require reopening the system’s core structure. A durable system reduces reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, and crisis-driven overhauls while prioritizing the most effective path to long-term fiscal health.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>

<p>These proposals are intentionally written in an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes">Amazon-style “Working Backwards” PR-FAQ format</a> by <a href="https://wwww.mattsly.com">Matt Sly</a>. I spent much of my career in technology and product development and wrote many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.</p>

<p>As a major caveat - I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I am approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.</p>

<p>Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.</p>

<h3 id="what-remains"><strong>What Remains</strong></h3>

<p>On optimistic assumptions, Phase 1 + Phase 2 + interest savings can close most (or even all) of the near‑term deficit gap. On conservative assumptions, a meaningful gap remains, so <strong>targeted spending cuts and modernization</strong> are still likely needed.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Interest savings are small in the early years and grow as avoided debt accumulates. A simple rule of thumb is <strong>interest savings ≈ cumulative debt avoided × average interest rate</strong>.
Example (10‑year, 4%): avoiding $6T of cumulative borrowing implies roughly <strong>$240B/year</strong> in interest savings once fully phased in.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Radical simplicity</strong>, so the system can be understood, automated, and debated honestly.</li>
  <li><strong>Fueling the climb rather than protecting the summit</strong>, rewarding work, saving, and entrepreneurship instead of complexity or dynastic advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Fiscal durability</strong>, so today’s policies do not quietly shift costs onto future generations.</li>
</ul>

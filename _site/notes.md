A few strong data points to consider adding:

**Tax Compliance Confidence:**
- IRS data shows ~40% of filers use professional tax prep services (H&R Block, tax attorneys, CPAs)
- Survey data: Only ~30% of Americans say they "fully understand" their tax obligations
- Gallup/AARP polls show majority of Americans find tax code "too complicated"

**Time Burden:**
- IRS estimates 7.1 billion hours annually on tax compliance (you cite this)
- That's roughly 21 hours per household per year
- Adds up to ~$213B in economic value lost to compliance alone

**Tax Gap:**
- IRS reports $600B+ annual "tax gap" (taxes owed but uncollected)
- Higher on capital gains and business income due to complexity
- Simplification directly improves collection rates

**Error Rates:**
- IRS audit data shows higher error rates on itemized deductions and complex credits
- EITC error rate ~24% (overpayment or underpayment)
- Simplification reduces these administrative errors

**Key Sources to Cite:**
- IRS Data Book (annual, public)
- Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances
- Brookings Institution reports on tax compliance
- Tax Foundation studies on compliance burden

I'd recommend adding a sentence or two around **line 3-4** of the press release noting: *"[X]% of Americans lack confidence in their tax filing, and the average household spends 21 hours annually on compliance."* This sets emotional stakes before launching into policy.

### Q19 passthrough draft (15% annual capital return) — condensed summary

* Proposed a 15% annual capital-return allowance (up to 10 years) on documented owner capital; excess profit taxed as ordinary income; capital-return amounts counted against the $1.5M lifetime exemption; capital gains at exit still available.
* Goal: end S-corp wage/distribution arbitrage, curb carried-interest treatment, and reward documented risk-taking; S-corp vs LLC choice becomes tax-neutral.
* Examples showed ~31% effective rates on $500K profit with $200K invested; modest revenue gain from closing arbitrage (~$15–25B net after allowing the preference).
* Mechanics: salary optimization becomes irrelevant; allowance expires after 10 years; “use it or lose it” each year; lifetime exemption brake limits double-dipping.

### Why we didn’t adopt the 15% capital-return approach

* **Complexity vs. simplicity goal:** Annual capital-base tracking, documentation tests, and 10-year timers add moving parts; harder to message than a salary floor plus a single residual allowance percentage.
* **Audit/gaming risk:** Fair-market-value disputes on contributed property; timing games on capital infusions; pressure to inflate basis to grow the 15% benefit.
* **Uneven by business type:** Capital-heavy firms benefit more than sweat-heavy firms; we want a uniform rule for founders, professionals, and small services.
* **Overlap with lifetime exemption:** Annual capital-return amounts already consume the exemption, but still invite double counting debates and recordkeeping friction.
* **Fiscal uncertainty:** Revenue swing depends on capital-basis assertions; harder to bound than a flat residual percentage with a salary floor.
* **Cleaner alternative chosen:** The $120K compensation floor + 20% residual sweat-equity allowance (counting against the lifetime exemption) gives parity or better outcomes with fewer calculations and clearer guardrails.






Phases:

PHASE 1: "The Billionaire Loophole Closure Act" (2025-2026)
What's in it:

Buy-borrow-die closure (asset-backed borrowing triggers deemed realization)
Simplified income tax brackets (6 brackets: 4%, 12%, 23%, 36%, 39%, 45%)
Stepped-up basis elimination (phased: $50M+ estates first 3 years, $20M+ next 3 years, then universal)
AMT/NIIT elimination + progressive lifetime capital gains rates (0% → 15% → 20% → 27% → 32%)
$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption (replaces $500K home exclusion with universal exemption)
Pass-through & Carrieed Interest reform: $120K salary minimum + 50% of profits above salary at cap gains (counts toward exemption) + 50% ordinary income with SE tax
Universal $6,000/child benefit (consolidates CTC, EITC, childcare credits)

Revenue: $150-250B annually (when fully phased)
Political sell: "Close loopholes that only benefit ultra-wealthy, simplify taxes for everyone else by eliminating AMT/NIIT, and give every American a $1.5M lifetime exemption for building wealth."
Feasibility: HIGH - Pure loophole closure + simplification sweetener

PHASE 2: "The Social Security Solvency Act" (2027-2028)
What's in it:

Eliminate Social Security wage cap (6.2% on all wages, no ceiling)
Reduce self-employment tax 15.3% → 12%
Minor benefit reforms (means-test top 5%, raise retirement age 2 months for those under 50)

Revenue: $150-200B annually
Political sell: "Social Security trust fund depletes in 2033. This fixes it for 75+ years without cutting benefits for 95% of Americans. High earners finally contribute on all income. Small business owners get a tax cut."
Feasibility: MEDIUM-HIGH - Crisis creates urgency as 2033 approaches

PHASE 3: "The Universal Savings & Family Security Act" (2029-2030)
What's in it:
American Savings Account (ASA) - one account replaces 15+ types
Optional 12% conversion from legacy 401(k)/IRA (10-year window)

Revenue/Cost: Roughly neutral ($50-100B net cost)

ASA conversion generates one-time windfall ($1.2-1.3T over 10 years)

Political sell: "One retirement account instead of 15. One child benefit instead of three. Six simple brackets. Optional conversion at bargain 12% rate. This is what simplification actually looks like."
Feasibility: MEDIUM - Easier after Phases 1-2 build trust

PHASE 4: "The Final Simplification" (2031+)
What's in it:

Eliminate mortgage interest deduction (standard deduction already higher)
SALT → universal 10% credit (automatic, capped at $10K)
Charitable deduction → 30% universal credit (capped at 25% of tax liability)
Student loan interest, energy credits, home office → direct programs (outside tax code)

Revenue: $100-150B annually
Political sell: "No more hidden subsidies. Same treatment for everyone. If government wants to subsidize something, do it openly through direct programs - not buried in tax forms."
Feasibility: LOW-MEDIUM - Hardest phase, only works after 1-3 succeed

Why This Sequencing:

Phase 1 = Easy win (villains are billionaires, benefits are universal)
Phase 2 = Crisis-driven (SS depletion focuses minds)
Phase 3 = Rewards for trust (tangible benefits after proving you can execute)
Phase 4 = Cleanup (final distortions, only possible if 1-3 worked)

Total when fully implemented: $400-600B in annual deficit reduction

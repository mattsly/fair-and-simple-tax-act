The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a proposal to "refactor U.S." fiscal policy.

### Why This Matters
The U.S. tax system raises revenue in ways that are opaque, uneven, and increasingly disconnected from how Americans actually earn money and build wealth. It punishes work more reliably than wealth, rewards financial engineering over productive activity, and requires an entire parallel industry just to navigate it. The result is a system that is widely resented, poorly understood, and politically brittle.

At the same time, we are heading into a decade defined by two unavoidable realities:
1. An aging population that will put sustained pressure on Social Security and Medicare
2. A labor market that looks nothing like the one the tax code was designed for

Layering new credits on top of old deductions, or carving out yet another exception, only deepens the problem. Complexity itself has become a form of unfairness.

This proposal starts from a different premise:

If the tax code were simple, durable, and legible to ordinary citizens, many downstream problems would become easier to solve.

The policy design is based on three fundamental tenets (see below). These tenets will be referenced throughout, and are included in each independant proposal.

Phase 1 modernizes how we tax income and capital so that work, saving, and entrepreneurship are treated consistently and transparently.

Phase 2 strengthens Social Security by broadening its funding base in a way that reflects today’s economy, without cutting benefits for typical workers.

The goal is not to “win” a partisan argument or to optimize for a single constituency. It’s to build a tax system that can plausibly last: one that people can understand, comply with, and debate honestly.

A tax system that no one trusts cannot sustain a democratic society for long. This is an attempt to rebuild that trust, starting with the fundamentals.

### Why I'm Doing This

I’ve paid taxes as a student, a teacher, a W-2 employee, a startup employee, a founder, an executive, and an investor. I’ve filed as single and married, with and without kids. I’ve done my taxes by hand, used consumer software, hired professionals, filed extensions, and dealt with edge cases that only show up once you’ve lived in the system for a long time. None of this makes me special, but it does give me a wide, practical view of how the tax code actually behaves in the real world.

What stands out is not that taxes are too high or too low. It’s that the system is far more complex than it needs to be, in ways that actively distort behavior and undermine trust.

I’m a systems thinker by training and by instinct. I’ve spent my career designing and maintaining software systems, and one lesson carries across domains: complexity is not neutral. Every extra rule, exception, and workaround increases failure modes, shifts power to intermediaries, and makes honest reasoning harder. When a system becomes too complex to explain clearly, it stops being governable. The tax code now feels like a software system that has never been refactored, only patched.

I’m also an experienced product leader. Whether we like it or not, we are all customers of our government, and the tax code is how most of us interact with it most directly. For many households, taxes are the single largest “purchase” they make each year. Yet the experience is opaque, stressful, and often dependent on professional help. In any other domain, we would call that a design failure. A well-designed tax system should feel more like a simple checkout flow than a legal obstacle course. That means thinking explicitly about different user personas, defaults, automation, and clarity, not just statutory intent.

I sold a company a few years ago and now have time to work on problems that sit at the intersection of systems, numbers, and fairness. This is exactly that kind of problem. I’m not approaching it as an academic exercise or a campaign platform, but as a design challenge: how do we build a tax system that is simpler, more legible, and more durable over time?

Finally, I’m doing this as an American citizen and a parent. I’m concerned about the long-term fiscal health of the country my kids will inherit, and about a political environment that makes sensible reform feel impossible. I believe we need to find a middle ground that protects and rewards innovation and work, while also acknowledging the systemic risks of extreme and growing wealth inequality.

This proposal is an attempt to bring a fresh perspective, without a political agenda, to a system that desperately needs one.

## Proposals

These proposals are intentionally written in an [Amazon-style "Working Backwards" PR-FAQ format](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes) by [Matt Sly](https://wwww.mattsly.com). I spent much of my career in technology and product development and wrote many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.

As a major caveat - I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I am approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.

Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

#### [Phase 1: Income Tax Reform](phase_1_income_tax_reform_pr_faq.md) Eliminate loopholes and complexity, introduce new top bracket, universal child credit, and a **Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance** with a lifetime rate table. 

#### [Phase 2: Social Security Modernization](phase_2_social_security_modernization_pr_faq.md): Restore solvency and protect current and future retirees.

#### Phase 3: American Opportunity Accounts (Coming Soon)

## Fiscal Sustainability Summary

This project is designed to be additive across phases, but it does not replace the need for spending reform.

### **Current Fiscal Baseline (Illustrative)**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | ~\$1.7T (~6% of GDP) | ~\$840B–1.14T (3–4% of GDP) | ~\$600B–1.12T annually |
| **Over 10 Years** | ~\$17T of deficit | ~\$8.4T–11.4T sustainable | Need to reduce by ~$6.0T–11.2T |

### **Project Impact (Illustrative Annual)**

| Component | Annual Impact | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1** | **\$200–310B** | Base‑broadening and loophole closure |
| **Phase 2** | **\$310–350B** | Long‑run Social Security gap reduction (steady‑state, illustrative) |
| **Interest Savings** | **\$20–50B (near‑term)** | Scales over time with debt avoided and rates |

### **What Remains**

On optimistic assumptions, Phase 1 + Phase 2 + interest savings can close most (or even all) of the near‑term deficit gap. On conservative assumptions, a meaningful gap remains, so **targeted spending cuts and modernization** are still likely needed.

*Note:* Interest savings are small in the early years and grow as avoided debt accumulates. A simple rule of thumb is **interest savings ≈ cumulative debt avoided × average interest rate**.
Example (10‑year, 4%): avoiding $6T of cumulative borrowing implies roughly **$240B/year** in interest savings once fully phased in.

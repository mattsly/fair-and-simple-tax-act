# **Press Release**

**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The U.S. tax code is broken: too complex to understand, too riddled with loopholes for the wealthy, and contributing to an unsustainable deficit that is too large. Today, bipartisan leaders introduced the American Tax Fairness Act — the first phase of comprehensive tax reform built on three principles: radical simplicity, fairness that fuels upward mobility, and fiscal durability.

### **Three principles, one system**

**Simplicity that restores transparency.** The current Internal Revenue Code spans 2,600 pages of statute and 10,000 pages of regulations. This bill takes the first major step toward radical simplification by eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, streamlining income brackets, and closing complex loopholes. Future phases will eliminate itemized deductions entirely, enabling pre-filled returns for most Americans. Complexity has been weaponized by special interests; this bill begins dismantling that system.

**Fairness that fuels the climb.** Everyone from everyday Americans building an emergency fund to patient savers to entrepreneurs to professional investors gets a real incentive to invest and save — a \$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption and simplified pass-through rules. But extreme wealth — the kind that hires lawyers to exploit stepped-up basis, buy-borrow-die strategies, and carried interest loopholes — pays its share. The system rewards genuine value creation, not tax engineering. The system stops rewarding complexity and starts rewarding the climb.

**Fiscal durability from Day 1.** This bill is revenue-positive, generating \$200–310 billion annually by closing loopholes and broadening the base. No gimmicks. No optimistic projections. Just structural reforms that collect what's owed and fund what matters. This bill represents the first step in a broader fiscal strategy — closing a significant portion of the gap between today's 6% of GDP deficit and the sustainable 3–4% target. Additional tax reforms to address retirement security and further simplification, combined with parallel spending reforms, will complete the path to fiscal sustainability.

### **What supporters are saying**

'This bill closes loopholes that let billionaires avoid taxes entirely while working families pay full freight. When someone earns a million dollars, they pay tax. When someone inherits a billion dollars? Under current law, zero. That's not a feature—it's a loophole, and this bill closes it.'

— *Senior Democratic Senator*

'We eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax—something Republicans have fought for—and pay for it by closing the stepped-up basis loophole that costs us $100 billion a year. We protect family farms and businesses with 15-year payment flexibility. This is fiscal responsibility: real revenue from real loopholes, not fantasy growth projections.'

— *Senior Republican Senator*

'We're getting $4,000 per kid, my filing is simpler, and billionaires finally pay their share. That's real money—money we're putting toward college savings. This actually helps families like ours.'

— *Middle‑class parent, Ohio*

'My family has built this business over 30 years. The $1.5 million capital gains exemption means when I eventually sell or pass it to my kids, we're protected. And if they inherit it, they have 15 years to pay any tax—no forced sale. This rewards building, not financial engineering.'

— *Small business owner, Arizona*

# **Tenets**

1. **Radical Simplicity**: If a rule cannot be automated or clearly explained to a normal taxpayer, it does not belong in the tax code.  
2. **Fuel the Climb**: The system should reward families building wealth and entrepreneurs creating companies — not financial engineering or entrenched dynastic wealth that concentrates power across generations.  
3. **Fiscal Durability**: The reform is revenue-positive from Day 1 (\$200–310B annually), closing loopholes and broadening the base so the tax system actually collects what it is owed — putting the nation on a sustainable path without relying on optimistic growth assumptions.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## **Part 1: The Big Picture**

## **Q2: How much simpler is this really?**

**The American Tax Fairness Act (ATFA) dismantles the complex machinery that dynastic wealth exploits.**

The current tax code's sprawling complexity (thousands of pages of statute and regulations) isn't just annoying—it's weaponized. Edge-case loopholes and financial engineering workarounds are deliberately obscure, allowing extreme wealth to compound indefinitely while ordinary Americans pay their full share.

**The American Tax Fairness Act targets the highest-value avoidance strategies:**

* **Stepped-up basis at death** — The $300B+ loophole letting appreciated assets pass tax-free across generations
* **Buy-borrow-die** — Living off asset-backed loans to avoid ever selling (and ever paying tax)
* **Carried interest** — Reclassifying labor income as capital gains (closed structurally via 45% convergence)
* **QSBS carve-outs** — Sector-specific preferential treatment that creates distortions
* **Backdoor ROTH and mega-ROTH sheltering** — Workarounds that let billionaires shelter billions tax-free
* **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** — A parallel tax system that adds complexity without solving the underlying problem
* **Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)** — Another layered system that complicates rather than clarifies

**Why this matters beyond simplicity**

When tax rules are incomprehensible, enforcement becomes impossible. Complex carve-outs become permanent subsidies for those who can afford specialists to exploit them. The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces this with clear, universal rules:

* Eight income brackets (adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners)
* One lifetime capital gains exemption ($1.5M per person)
* Death = realization event (no basis step-up)
* Progressive capital gains convergence at $100M+ (45%, matching ordinary income)

For typical filers, nothing changes structurally—you still file once a year with standard forms. But the system stops rewarding financial engineering and starts rewarding genuine value creation.

**This is the foundation.** Future reforms can build on this base to further simplify filing, consolidate savings vehicles, and reduce compliance burdens for working families. But first, we close the loopholes that let dynastic wealth avoid taxation entirely.

---

## **Q3: Who benefits and who pays more?**

### **The short answer**

* **Working and middle-class families:** pay less  
* **Upper-middle-class families under \$400K:** protected from increases  
* **Extreme wealth:** pays more, through broader bases and higher top-end rates  
* **Everyone:** saves time and money on compliance

### **The pattern**

* Income tax brackets match current law (no change for most workers)
* Families with children benefit from expanded $4K/child credit  
* Capital gains below \$1.5M are tax-free (replaces the primary residence exclusion with a universal lifetime exemption), progressive rates above that (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%)  
* Very large incomes ($1.5M+) and very large fortunes contribute more through the new 45% bracket

**In plain terms:**  
A nurse or teacher with kids saves money through the child benefit. A small business owner with capital gains under $1.5M pays nothing on those gains. A nine-figure fortune pays more.

---

## **Q4: How far does this go toward a responsible federal budget?**

The American Tax Fairness Act is **revenue-positive from Day 1**.

It achieves this by:

* Adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners: +$40-60B annually
* Closing stepped-up basis loophole (death = realization event): +$75-100B annually
* Closing buy-borrow-die and other avoidance strategies: +$25-50B annually
* Estate tax reform (lower exemption, broader base): +$50-65B annually
* Progressive capital gains rates above $1.5M exemption: +$50-80B annually
* QSBS elimination (universal $1.5M exemption instead): +$10-20B annually
* ROTH mega-account reforms (contribution freeze + death taxation of gains): +$15-25B annually
* **Total: $265-400B in new annual revenue**

These gains easily cover the costs ($50-70B for AMT/NIIT elimination and expanded child benefits), resulting in **$200-310B net annual revenue**.

### **What else is needed to have a responsible federal budget?**

It's a good first step, but not sufficient on its own.

**Current fiscal reality:**
* Federal deficit: ~6% of GDP (~$2 trillion annually)
* Sustainable target: 3-4% of GDP
* Gap to close: $1-1.5 trillion annually

**This Act contributes $200-310B annually** — closing roughly 15-25% of the gap through structural tax reform that collects what's owed without relying on optimistic growth assumptions.

**What's needed beyond this Act:**

* **Additional revenue measures** — Further tax reform phases addressing Social Security solvency, retirement account simplification, and broader base-broadening
* **Spending reforms** — Built on the same tenets (simplicity, fairness, durability) to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and ensure programs deliver value
* **"Meet in the middle" approach** — Both sides contribute: progressives accept structural spending reforms, conservatives accept closing loopholes that let extreme wealth avoid taxation

See [Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability](#appendix-c-path-to-fiscal-sustainability) for the complete fiscal strategy.

**The bottom line:** This Act is fiscally responsible and revenue-positive, but achieving long-term balance requires both tax reforms (like this one) and parallel spending discipline. No single bill solves everything — but this is a credible, structural first step.

## **Part 2: Core Mechanics**

---

## **Q5: How do the new income tax brackets work?**

ATFA keeps income tax brackets close to current law while eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). The key change is adding a 45% top bracket for very high earners.

**Income tax bracket thresholds (indexed annually for inflation)**

| Filing Status | 10% | 12% | 22% | 24% | 32% | 35% | 37% | 45% |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Single | $0–$12K | $12K–$47K | $47K–$100K | $100K–$190K | $190K–$240K | $240K–$610K | $610K–$1.5M | $1.5M+ |
| Married filing jointly | $0–$24K | $24K–$94K | $94K–$200K | $200K–$380K | $380K–$490K | $490K–$730K | $730K–$3M | $3M+ |
| Head of household | $0–$17K | $17K–$63K | $63K–$160K | $160K–$290K | $290K–$365K | $365K–$670K | $670K–$2.25M | $2.25M+ |

**What changes from current law:**
- AMT eliminated (no more parallel tax calculation)
- NIIT eliminated (investment income taxed through capital gains system instead)
- 45% top bracket added ($1.5M+ Single / $3M+ MFJ)

**What stays the same:**
- Standard brackets through 37% remain essentially unchanged
- Most taxpayers see no change in income tax rates

**Why this approach:** ATFA focuses on closing loopholes for extreme wealth, not restructuring brackets for ordinary earners. The 45% top bracket ensures very high earners contribute more, while the aggressive simplification of brackets is reserved for future phases when payroll tax reform is included.

---

## **Q6: How are capital gains, dividends, and investment income taxed?**

We introduce a new paradigm to determine Capital Gains rates based on lifetime total of capital gains. This is both to encourage saving early in life, and to recognize that many gains occur after multiple years of investment. We also recognize that "wealth begets wealth", and it is not fair to allow for the extremely wealthy (+$100M) to pay a lower tax rate than someone making $300K.

**At $100M+ in lifetime gains, capital gains rates converge with ordinary income rates (45%)** — eliminating any incentive to reclassify labor income as capital gains at extreme wealth levels.

### **Capital Gains (Asset Appreciation)**

| Cumulative Lifetime Gains |  Marginal Capital Gains Rate |
| ----- | ----- |
| \$0 – \$1.5M | **0%** |
| \$1.5M – \$3M | **15%** |
| \$3M – \$10M | **20%** |
| \$10M – \$50M | **27%** |
| \$50M – \$100M | **32%** |
| \$100M+ | **45%** |

Key rules:

* Assets must be held **more than one year** to qualify  
* Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income  
* The exemption is **\$1.5M per person** — married couples filing jointly can combine exemptions for a **\$3M combined exemption**
* In divorce, each person retains whatever portion of their individual exemption remains unused
* The exemption applies across all assets — once you've used \$1.5M in gains, you're done

**Implementation: Lifetime gains tracking begins on ATFA enactment date**

When the Act takes effect, the lifetime gains counter resets to zero for all taxpayers. Gains realized **after enactment** count toward the $1.5M exemption. Prior years' realized gains are not backfilled into the system.

This approach:
* Simplifies administration (no need to audit historical tax returns or reconstruct basis)
* Eliminates arguments about which gains "should" have counted
* Treats all taxpayers fairly going forward (a level playing field from Day 1)
* Achieves the policy goal: preventing indefinite deferral of taxation going forward

This structure protects ordinary wealth-building while ensuring very large gains contribute more.

### **Capital Losses**

* Capital losses offset capital gains without limit (same as current law)
* Up to $3,000/year can offset ordinary income (same as current law)
* Unused losses carry forward indefinitely (same as current law)

### **Dividends (Investment Yield)**

* **Qualified dividends** — Taxed at capital gains rates based on the filer's cumulative lifetime gains (not the $1.5M exemption)
* **Ordinary dividends** — Taxed as ordinary income (same as current law)
* Dividends do NOT count toward the $1.5M lifetime exemption — the exemption is reserved for capital appreciation only

### **Interest Income & Foreign Investments**

* Municipal bond interest — Tax-exempt (unchanged)
* All other interest — Taxed as ordinary income (unchanged)
* Foreign dividends — Taxed under same rules as domestic dividends with foreign tax credit (unchanged)

---

## **Q7: What is the Child Tax Credit under this plan, and how is it different from today?**

The Act replaces three overlapping programs with one simple, universal benefit.

### **Today's System: Complex, Hidden, Unequal**

The current system spreads child support across three separate programs, creating confusion and leaving money on the table:

**Child Tax Credit (CTC):**
* Up to \$2,000 per child
* Phases out starting at \$200,000 (single) or \$400,000 (married)
* Only \$1,700 is refundable (meaning lower-income families get less)
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$200B

**Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):**
* Varies wildly: \$600 for no kids, up to \$7,430 for three+ children
* Rewards work but penalizes earning above thresholds
* Requires earned income (excludes caregivers, retirees, disabled)
* 15%+ error rate due to complexity
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$70B

**Child and Dependent Care Credit:**
* 20-35% of childcare costs (max \$2,100 for two+ children)
* Only helps those who itemize
* Requires receipts and provider tax IDs
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$6B

**Total current system: ~\$276B annually**

**The Problem:** This Byzantine structure creates perverse incentives. Families face "benefits cliffs" where earning \$100 more means losing \$500 in benefits. Filing is complicated. Support is unpredictable.

**A win for stay-at-home parents:** Today, a parent staying home to care for children gets nothing from the childcare credit because you can't claim expenses you don't incur. The Fair & Simple Tax Act changes this: under the new system, you get the full \$4,000 per child benefit automatically, whether or not you pay for daycare. A parent providing childcare themselves gets exactly the same \$4K per child as a parent paying for outside daycare. This actually recognizes the economic value of unpaid care work.

### **The Fair & Simple System: Universal \$4,000 per Child**

* **\$4,000 per child per year** (full benefit for families earning under \$120K)
* **Progressive phase-out** — reduces linearly for incomes \$120K–\$400K, reaches \$0 at \$400K+
* **Fully refundable** — the full amount for those under \$120K

**Phase-out formula:**
- Income ≤ \$120K: Full \$4K per child
- \$120K < Income < \$400K: (Kids × \$4K) × [1 − (Income − \$120K) / \$280K]
- Income ≥ \$400K: \$0

**New system cost: ~\$220B annually**  
**Current system cost: ~\$276B (CTC + EITC + childcare)**  
**Net savings: ~\$56B per year**

### **The Complete Picture: How Families Come Out Ahead**

The child benefit provides significant relief, and combined with **simpler filing and eliminated loopholes**, working families see meaningful improvements in take-home pay.

**A single parent with 2 children earning \$28K** sees an immediate boost of **\$4,460 per year** (16% gain) from the \$8K child benefit replacing the current byzantine EITC/CTC structure. See [Case Study 1 (Appendix B)](#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies) for full details.

**A married couple with 1 child earning \$75K** gains **\$2,000 annually** from the simplified \$4K benefit — not just extra money, but also the elimination of filing complexity and benefit-cliff anxiety. See [Case Study 2](#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies) for the complete breakdown.

**A married couple with 2 children earning \$150K** receives **\$7,143 per year** (the phased benefit) instead of juggling multiple programs with conflicting income limits. See [Case Study 3](#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies) for full calculations.

The pattern is consistent: **every family with children gets a predictable, portable benefit that doesn't disappear when they earn another \$100.**

### **Why This Works**

The Fair & Simple system accomplishes what current patchwork programs cannot:

1. **Predictability** — families know exactly what they'll receive
2. **Universality** — the same benefit for everyone with children
3. **Smooth phase-out** — linear reduction from $120K–$400K eliminates "benefits cliffs"
4. **Administrative efficiency** — consolidating three programs into one reduces overhead and fraud

**The political genius:** This appeals across the aisle. Conservatives like that we're simplifying government and cutting fraud. Progressives like that every family with children gets automatic support with no conditions attached.

# Part 3: Closing Loopholes

---

## **Q8: What are the ROTH account reforms, and why close the "Peter Thiel loophole"?**

The Act makes four changes to ROTH IRAs that together eliminate mega-account abuse while dramatically expanding access for ordinary savers.

### **The Four ROTH Reforms**

**1. Eliminate Income Limits → Universal Access**

Current law prevents high earners from contributing to ROTH IRAs directly (income limits: ~$240K married). This created the "backdoor ROTH" workaround: contribute to a non-deductible traditional IRA, then immediately convert to ROTH.

**ATFA reform:** Remove income phase-outs entirely. Anyone can contribute directly to a ROTH, regardless of income.

**Why:** The income limit does nothing except create complexity—wealthy people already circumvent it through backdoor conversions. Eliminating the limit removes the workaround and opens ROTH access universally.

**2. Raise Contribution Cap: $7K → $15K per year**

Current limit: $7,000/year ($8,000 if 50+)

**ATFA reform:** $15,000/year (indexed to inflation), hard cap from any source

**Why:** 
* Doubles savings capacity for working families
* Republican-friendly: rewards personal responsibility and wealth building
* Math: $15K × 50 years × 7% growth ≈ $3.2M maximum through normal contributions

**3. Contribution Freeze at $2.5M Account Balance**

**ATFA reform:** Once ROTH balance reaches $2.5M (measured January 1), no new contributions until balance drops below $2.5M. Existing balance can grow through investment returns indefinitely.

**Why:**
* Prevents mega-account accumulation going forward
* Doesn't punish lucky investors (if your $500K grows to $4M, that's protected)
* Nearly impossible to hit $2.5M through normal contributions alone
* Aligns with Phase 3 ASA cap (also $2.5M in tax-free withdrawals)

**Example:**
* 2027: ROTH hits $2.5M → Can't contribute in 2027
* 2028: Market grows it to $3.2M → Still can't contribute (but growth is protected)
* 2029: Market crashes to $2.2M → Can contribute again

**4. Death = Realization of Gains**

**Current law:** Inherited ROTHs are tax-free forever. Beneficiaries take distributions over 10 years, but pay zero tax.

**ATFA reform:** At death, ROTH **gains** (account value minus total contributions) are treated as capital gains:
* Contributions: Already taxed when earned, no additional tax at death
* Gains: Use decedent's remaining lifetime capital gains exemption ($1.5M), then taxed at applicable rates
* 15-year payment flexibility at 1% interest (same as all death realizations)
* Beneficiaries inherit the after-tax amount

**Why:**
* Consistent with stepped-up basis elimination: death is a realization event for all gains
* No double taxation complaint—we tax gains only, not contributions
* ROTH providers already track contributions vs. gains
* Protects normal savers: 99.9% of ROTHs have < $1.5M in gains (covered by exemption)

### **The Peter Thiel Example**

Peter Thiel famously grew his ROTH IRA from ~$2,000 to $5 billion by placing founder shares (valued at pennies) into the account before PayPal's IPO. Current law: that $5 billion grows and can be withdrawn completely tax-free.

**Under ATFA reforms:**

**During his lifetime:**
* Keeps the $5B ROTH (no forced distribution)
* Can't contribute more (account > $2.5M)
* Can spend it tax-free

**At death:**
* ROTH balance: $5B
* Total contributions: ~$2,000
* **Taxable gains: ~$5B**
* Tax calculation:
  * First $1.5M: Tax-free (lifetime exemption)
  * Remaining $4.998B: Likely taxed at 45% (he has other lifetime gains > $100M)
  * Tax: ~$2.25B
  * Estate keeps: ~$2.75B
  * 15-year payment plan available at 1% interest

**Heirs inherit ~$2.75B** instead of $5B tax-free.

### **Normal Saver Example**

**Scenario:** You contribute $400K over 40 years. Account grows to $1.2M at death.

* Total contributions: $400K
* Gains: $800K
* Tax at death: **$0** (gains under $1.5M exemption)
* Heirs inherit: Full $1.2M

**The reforms protect 99.9% of savers while closing the loophole that let billionaires shelter billions.**

### **Political Narrative**

**Democrats:** "We're closing the Peter Thiel loophole that let him shelter $5 billion tax-free."

**Republicans:** "We're doubling ROTH capacity to $15K and opening it to everyone—letting families build wealth. And we're paying for it by stopping mega-account abuse."

**Everyone:** "No more backdoor conversion games. Just contribute directly."

### **Revenue: $15-25B annually**

Mostly from taxing mega-ROTH gains at death. Contribution shift from pre-tax to ROTH is roughly revenue-neutral in the 10-year budget window (actually slight positive, since tax is collected now instead of deferred).

Long-term (30+ years), ROTH expansion costs revenue as retirees withdraw tax-free. But this is outside budget scoring window and offset by reduced entitlement pressure from increased private savings.

---

### **The Core Problem: Complexity Enables Avoidance**

The current tax code is so complex that it has become a system optimized for **non-compliance by design**. When rules are incomprehensible, enforcement becomes impossible. When special rules proliferate, wealthy taxpayers hire specialists to exploit them. And when ordinary Americans can't understand the rules, they lose faith in the system itself.

The result is massive fiscal leakage:

The "tax gap" — the difference between taxes owed and taxes collected — **exceeds \$600 billion annually** according to the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate. [^1] That's not a rounding error. That's half the annual defense budget. That's the entire budget of the Department of Education.

But the tax gap is only part of the story. Beyond non-compliance, there are entire **legal strategies** built into the tax code that allow extreme wealth to avoid taxation indefinitely:

* **Stepped-up basis at death** allows \~\$300 billion in gains to escape taxation every year
* **Buy-borrow-die strategies** let billionaires live off asset-backed loans while never selling appreciated assets, paying zero tax on the economic gain
* **QSBS and carried interest** carve-outs create preferential treatment for specific industries
* **Foundations and dynasty trusts** allow wealth to compound across generations tax-free

These aren't accidents or oversights. They're embedded features of a code so complex that most Americans — and many policymakers — don't even know they exist.

### **Why This Matters**

When the wealthy can permanently avoid taxation while working families pay their full share, it does three things:

1. **Undermines fiscal sustainability** — deficits grow because revenue declines relative to GDP
2. **Corrodes public confidence** — people stop believing the system is fair
3. **Concentrates wealth and power** — dynasties of capital compound without limit or taxation

The Fair & Simple Tax Act addresses this by replacing complex carve-outs with simple, consistent rules that apply equally to everyone.

## **Q9: How does the Act close the 'buy, borrow, die' loophole?**

### **What is 'Buy, Borrow, Die'?**

This is a tax avoidance strategy available exclusively to ultra-wealthy individuals who own highly appreciated assets. Here's how it works today:

**Step 1: Buy an appreciating asset**
You purchase Apple stock for \$100 million when the company is young and undiscovered.

**Step 2: Borrow against it**
Twenty years later, Apple stock is worth \$5 billion. Instead of selling the stock (which would trigger a capital gains tax on your \$4.9 billion profit), you borrow \$500 million using the stock as collateral. You pay interest on the loan, but you've accessed wealth tax-free.

**Step 3: Live off the borrowed money**
You use the \$500 million loan to fund a lavish lifestyle — yachts, jets, real estate, anything. The loan is not income, so you pay no tax on it. You can borrow repeatedly as the asset appreciates, accessing unlimited wealth.

**Step 4: Die with a stepped-up basis**
When you die, the heir inherits the \$5 billion in Apple stock with a 'stepped-up basis' — the IRS resets the cost basis to its value at death. The \$4.9 billion in gains simply **disappear from the tax system**. The heir can immediately sell the stock and owe zero capital gains tax.

**Net result:** You and your heirs extracted \$500 million in economic benefit, funded a lifestyle for decades, and paid zero in capital gains taxes on \$4.9 billion in appreciation. The \$500 million in loans are repaid from the inherited assets after stepping up the basis, often leaving the estate larger than it started.

### **How common is this?**

This strategy is used exclusively by ultra-high-net-worth individuals. It requires:

* Assets worth tens of millions or more
* Ability to borrow substantial amounts against them  
* Estate planning sophistication  
* Access to specialized financial advisors  

It's not a strategy available to the merely wealthy — you need dynastic levels of wealth to make it work. But for those who can use it, it's devastatingly effective.

**Estimates:** Between 10,000 and 50,000 ultra-wealthy households may use buy-borrow-die strategies at any given time, though the practice is heavily concentrated among the top 0.01% of wealth holders. Goldman Sachs estimated in 2021 that the annual federal tax revenue loss from this single strategy exceeds \$50 billion.[^2]

### **Why does it work today?**

Two rules work together to enable this loophole:

1. **Loans are not taxable income** — borrowing money is not treated as income, so there's no tax when you take out a loan (and interest payments are often tax-deductible as well)
2. **Stepped-up basis at death** — when you die, your heirs inherit assets with a basis reset to death-day value, erasing all prior gains from the tax system

Together, these two rules create a bizarre outcome: a billionaire can live entirely off borrowed money for decades (no income tax), access unlimited untaxed wealth (no capital gains tax), and pass that wealth to heirs without ever triggering a tax on the appreciation (no tax at death).

### **How does the Fair & Simple Tax Act fix it?**

The Act closes this loophole by treating asset-backed borrowing differently:

**New Rule: Borrowing Against Appreciated Assets Triggers Tax**

* When you borrow against an appreciated asset (one worth more than you paid for it), the excess value of the loan triggers a deemed sale and taxable gain  
* The tax is calculated on the appreciation only (not the entire asset value)  
* The tax is deferred until the loan is repaid or the asset is sold

**Applied to our Apple example:**

* You own Apple stock with a cost basis of \$100M, currently worth \$5B  
* You borrow \$500M against the stock  
* The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats this as a partial deemed sale  
* You recognize \$400M in capital gains (the amount your stock appreciated above what you borrowed: \$500M loan minus \$100M cost basis)  
* You owe capital gains tax on \$400M in gains using the lifetime exemption and progressive rates (if you've already used your \$1.5M exemption, this is taxed at 15%, 20%, 27%, or 32% depending on your total lifetime gains)  
* Your basis steps up to \$500M (the amount borrowed), so your remaining unrealized gains are only \$4.5B (\$5B current value minus \$500M new basis) — preventing double taxation if you later sell or pass the asset to heirs
* You can still borrow the money, but the tax is owed in the year of borrowing (or can be deferred if the asset is illiquid, with interest accruing)

**Why this works:**

This aligns taxation with economic reality. A billionaire borrowing \$500M against appreciated stock has received an economic benefit — they've accessed and consumed wealth. The fact that they technically haven't 'sold' the asset is a mere formality. The Fair & Simple Tax Act says: if you've extracted economic value through borrowing, you owe tax on the gain you've realized, just as if you had sold and repurchased the asset.

**Stepped-up basis is eliminated:**

The current stepped-up basis rule was created decades ago as an administrative convenience — tracking the original cost basis of assets across decades of ownership was thought to be too burdensome and expensive. So policymakers simply reset the basis at death, making accounting easier.

But this "simplification" became a massive loophole. Today, when billionaires die with \$100+ billion in unrealized gains, those gains simply vanish from the tax system. The wealthy learned to exploit this administrative rule, turning it into a permanent wealth transfer device.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates this loophole by treating death as a realization event, just like selling an asset. When you die, unrealized gains are taxed on your final return using the same lifetime capital gains system. Your heirs inherit a 'clean basis' — the value at death becomes their cost basis. This closes the final loophole: they can't inherit \$5B in stock and immediately sell it tax-free.

### **What about legitimate lending?**

A common question: 'What if I borrow against my home or farm to invest?' or 'What if I take out a regular business loan?'

**The answer:** Regular loans for business or personal use are not affected. The rule applies only to **asset-backed loans where the collateral itself has appreciated above your cost basis and the loan amount exceeds your basis.**

Examples of what is NOT affected:

* A business takes out a \$10M bank loan to expand — no special tax  
* A farmer borrows \$5M against farmland to buy equipment — no special tax  
* A homeowner takes out a mortgage to buy a house — no special tax  
* A young entrepreneur borrows against a growing tech company to fund operations — no special tax (the company likely hasn't appreciated much yet)

**What about borrowing to fund innovation and business growth?**

A critical concern: does this rule discourage borrowing that fuels innovation, business expansion, and economic growth?

**No.** The rule does not apply to borrowing used to fund genuine business expansion, research, operations, or other reinvestment. The distinction is straightforward:

* **A venture capital fund** borrows \$500M against a portfolio company's appreciated equity to make other investments — **no special tax**. The borrowed money is being reinvested, creating jobs and economic activity.
* **A founder** borrows against her startup's equity to fund R&D, payroll, or expansion — **no special tax**. The borrowed money flows back into the business.
* **A private equity firm** borrows against portfolio company value to acquire additional companies or fund operations — **no special tax**. This is core business lending.
* **An entrepreneur** borrows against appreciated real estate to open a second location — **no special tax**. The funds are being reinvested in productive activity.

The rule applies only when borrowed funds are used for **personal consumption** (yachts, jets, luxury real estate, lifestyle expenses) rather than business reinvestment or productive economic activity.

**How is this distinction enforced?**

Lenders already track the stated purpose of loans — it's standard underwriting practice. Financial institutions would report:
1. The collateral asset and its appreciated value
2. The borrower's cost basis
3. The stated purpose of the loan (business investment vs. personal use)

The IRS already has well-established legal doctrines (substance-over-form, sham transaction doctrine) for addressing scenarios where claimed business purposes don't align with actual practice. Someone who borrows 'for consulting' but spends it all on a yacht would face the same scrutiny as someone who claims a vacation home is a 'rental property' but never rents it.

**The result:** Innovation and legitimate capital formation are unaffected — while the buy-borrow-die loophole (extracting \$500M to live on a yacht for 30 years without paying tax on appreciated assets) is closed.

### **Borrowing Rule Case Studies**

Here's how the rule works in practice across different scenarios:

#### **Case 1: The Cape Cod Doctor**

**Dr. Sarah Chen, 58, Primary Care Physician**

* Owns vacation home worth \$1.2M (cost basis: \$200K, gain: \$1M)
* Wants to borrow \$400K for daughter's medical school
* Current law: No tax triggered. At death, step-up eliminates the gain. **Total tax: \$0.**
* Fair & Simple: Loan (\$400K) exceeds basis (\$200K) by \$200K. Using her unused lifetime exemption, this is **tax-free.** Basis steps to \$400K.

**Dr. Chen's take:** "If I didn't have the exemption, I'd pay \$30K (15% × \$200K gain). That's 7.5% of the loan amount—less than my interest rate. And I know my tax bill upfront."

---

#### **Case 2: The Tech Founder**

**Marcus Williams, 42, Tech Startup Founder**

* Owns \$50M in company stock (cost basis: \$50K, gain: \$49.95M)
* Wants to borrow \$10M to buy a house (avoid selling shares and market signaling)
* Current law: No tax. Rolls interest-only debt. At death, step-up eliminates \$50M gain. **Total tax: \$0 (plus \~\$500K/year in perpetual interest).**
* Fair & Simple: Loan exceeds basis by \$9.95M. After using his \$1.5M lifetime exemption, he owes: 15% on \$1.5M + 20% on \$6.95M = **\$1.525M tax.** Basis steps to \$10M.

**Marcus's take:** "I pay \$1.5M upfront instead of zero. But I own my house free and clear, I've used my exemption, and I know the tax won't compound forever. Under the old system, I'd have rolled that debt indefinitely."

---

#### **Case 3: The Inherited Wealth Heir**

**Elizabeth "Bitsy" Thornton IV, 35, Trust Beneficiary**

* Inherits \$30M in stocks from grandmother (grandmother's basis: \$3M, gain: \$27M)
* Under old law: Bitsy would inherit with step-up to \$30M basis. **No tax ever on the \$27M gain.**
* Under Fair & Simple: Grandmother's estate paid ~\$6.5M in capital gains tax at death. Bitsy inherits with \$30M clean basis.
* Bitsy borrows \$5M against the portfolio. Loan (\$5M) < Basis (\$30M). **No additional tax triggered.**

**Bitsy's take:** "Grandma's estate paid decades of deferred taxes when she died. I inherited less money upfront, but with a clean slate. I can borrow, sell, or hold without surprise tax bills."

---

#### **Case 4: The Serial Entrepreneur**

**Raj Patel, 55, Three-Time Founder**

* Already used his \$1.5M lifetime exemption through two prior exits
* Current company worth \$20M (basis: \$100K)
* Wants to borrow \$3M for a new venture
* Loan exceeds basis by \$2.9M
* After exemption exhausted: 15% on \$1.5M + 20% on \$1.4M = **\$505K tax.**

**Raj's take:** "I've had a good run. I've used my exemption, I've paid taxes along the way. This \$500K on a \$3M loan is about 17%—not cheap, but I keep full control of my company without an eternal debt burden."

---

### **Impact**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act means:

* Billionaires can't live tax-free off borrowed money indefinitely  
* Wealth must eventually be taxed or passed to heirs who inherit with a clean basis (and then owe tax if they sell)  
* The step-up in basis loophole is closed  
* Families and small businesses are unaffected

**Bottom line:** Buy-borrow-die was a strategy that turned the tax system upside down, letting ultra-wealthy individuals treat borrowing as a substitute for selling, and stepping up basis as a substitute for paying what was owed. The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats borrowing as an economic event and treats death as a realization event — aligning the tax system with basic fairness.

## **Q10: What happens when someone dies?**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, death is treated as a realization event — unrealized capital gains are taxed on the final return, using the same lifetime capital gains system detailed in Q7. Heirs inherit assets with a 'clean basis' at the value at death.

### **How the lifetime exemption applies at death**

Everyone receives a **\$1.5 million lifetime capital gains exemption** that applies to all long-term gains during life — from home sales, stock sales, business exits, or any other appreciated asset.

**At death, any remaining unused exemption applies first to unrealized gains.** This means:

* If you've used \$500K of your lifetime exemption during life, you have **\$1M remaining** to shield unrealized gains at death
* If you've never sold an appreciated asset during life, your **full \$1.5M exemption** applies to unrealized gains at death
* If you've already used your full $1.5M exemption, unrealized gains are taxed using the progressive capital gains rates (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%, depending on your cumulative lifetime gains)

### **How it works in practice**

**Example 1: Typical Middle-Class Estate**

* You own a home worth \$600K (cost basis \$250K, gain \$350K)
* You have \$200K in retirement accounts (ASA, fully taxed or converted)
* You have \$150K in stock (cost basis \$100K, gain \$50K)
* **Total unrealized gains at death:** \$400K

**Tax owed:**
* Remaining lifetime exemption: \$1.5M (unused during life)
* Unrealized gains: \$400K
* Amount taxed: **\$0** (fully covered by exemption)
* Heirs inherit home and stock at stepped-up basis (\$600K and \$150K respectively)

**Example 2: Comfortable Retirement**

* You sold your home during life and used \$800K of your lifetime exemption
* At death, you own stock worth \$3M (cost basis \$1M, gain \$2M)
* **Remaining lifetime exemption:** \$700K

**Tax owed:**
* First \$700K of gain: **\$0** (covered by remaining exemption)
* Next \$1.3M of gain: taxed at 15% = **\$195K**
* **Total tax on final return:** \$195K
* Heirs inherit stock at stepped-up basis of \$3M (clean slate)

**Example 3: Very Large Estate**

* You used your full \$1.5M lifetime exemption during life (sold businesses, real estate, stocks)
* At death, you own \$100M in appreciated stock (cost basis \$20M, gain \$80M)
* **Remaining lifetime exemption:** \$0 (already used)

**Tax owed:**
* First \$1.5M of gain: 15% = \$225K
* Next \$7M of gain: 20% = \$1.4M
* Next \$40M of gain: 27% = \$10.8M
* Remaining \$31.5M of gain: 32% = \$10.08M
* **Total tax on final return:** \$22.5M (28% effective rate on \$80M in gains)
* Heirs inherit stock at stepped-up basis of \$100M

### **Why this is fair**

This system accomplishes several goals:

1. **Protects typical families:** Most Americans die with far less than \$1.5M in unrealized gains. Their estates owe nothing.

2. **Taxes only large fortunes:** Only estates with very large unrealized gains pay significant tax — and even then, only after using any remaining exemption.

3. **Preserves the lifetime system:** The same exemption and progressive rates apply throughout life and at death. No special rules, no separate estate tax schedules.

4. **Prevents permanent wealth avoidance:** Under current law, billionaires can die with \$100+ billion in unrealized gains and pass that wealth to heirs completely tax-free. The Fair & Simple Tax Act closes this loophole while protecting typical wealth accumulation.

5. **Heirs start fresh:** Heirs inherit assets at their value at death (the 'clean basis'), so they don't owe tax on pre-death appreciation. They only owe tax on gains that occur after they inherit.

### **What about illiquid assets?**

For estates holding illiquid assets (family farms, small businesses, real estate), the Act provides **payment flexibility**:

* Tax can be paid over 15 years at a low interest rate
* No forced asset sales
* Family businesses can continue operating

This ensures that typical family wealth transfers — passing down a farm, a family business, or rental property — are not disrupted.

### **The bottom line**

Death is no longer a magic eraser for unrealized gains. But the system protects typical families completely, provides generous exemptions even for large estates, and preserves intergenerational wealth transfers for productive assets.

**Most families owe nothing. Very large fortunes pay what has long been deferred.**

## **Q11: How does this close estate planning loopholes like GRATs, dynasty trusts, and valuation discounts?**

**The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates the underlying conditions that make sophisticated estate planning techniques work — without having to ban each one individually.**

For ultra-wealthy families, the current tax code isn't just complex — it's a toolkit for transferring billions across generations with minimal taxation. Most Americans have never heard of these strategies. But for families worth \$50 million or more, they're standard practice.

### **What are these techniques?**

Let's look at four major strategies — what they were originally designed to do, and how they became loopholes.

#### **1\. GRATs (Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts)**

**Original purpose:** Help families transfer a business to the next generation while the founder retains income during retirement.

**How it became a loophole:**
* You transfer \$100M in stock to a GRAT
* The GRAT pays you back exactly \$100M over 2 years (the IRS "hurdle rate")
* If the stock appreciates above the hurdle rate (say, to \$130M), your heirs get the \$30M gain **completely tax-free**
* If the stock goes down, the GRAT collapses and you're back where you started — **no penalty**

**Result:** It's a **zero-risk bet**. Billionaires run serial 2-year GRATs continuously, transferring hundreds of millions in appreciation with zero gift tax. The Walton family (Walmart) has reportedly used GRATs to transfer over \$100 billion to heirs.

#### **2\. Dynasty Trusts**

**Original purpose:** The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (1986) was meant to prevent wealthy families from skipping ONE generation to avoid estate tax twice.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Several states (South Dakota, Delaware, Nevada) abolished the "Rule Against Perpetuities" — the old common law rule that said trusts must eventually end
* Now trusts can last **500+ years**
* Wealth compounds tax-free across **10+ generations**
* Each generation gets distributions but never owns the assets, so **no estate tax is ever triggered**

**Result:** Families can place \$50M in a dynasty trust today, let it compound for 200 years, and transfer \$50+ billion to great-great-great-grandchildren without ever touching the estate tax system again.

#### **3\. Valuation Discounts (Family Limited Partnerships)**

**Original purpose:** A minority stake in a private business with no control or liquidity IS legitimately worth less than its proportional share.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Transfer \$100M in assets (stocks, real estate, whatever) to a Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
* Gift "minority interests" to your children
* Claim **30-40% valuation discounts** because the stakes have "no control" and "no liquidity"
* Even though the family collectively controls everything and can dissolve the FLP whenever they want

**Result:** Turn a \$100M taxable gift into a \$60-70M gift for tax purposes — saving \$12-16M in gift taxes. The IRS calls it a sham. Wealthy families do it anyway and fight the audits.

#### **4\. Private Foundations**

**Original purpose:** Encourage philanthropy by letting wealthy donors stay involved in charitable work.

**How it became a loophole:**
* Transfer \$500M in appreciated stock to a private foundation (no capital gains tax on the transfer)
* Family members get paid \$200K-500K salaries as "foundation managers"
* Assets grow tax-free forever
* Only **5% annual distribution required** — foundation can keep 95% of gains each year
* Family controls the foundation (and the capital) **in perpetuity**

**Result:** It's more wealth management vehicle than charity. The family avoids capital gains tax, gets paid to run it, controls where the money goes, and passes control to heirs — all while claiming to be "giving it away."

### **Why traditional reform doesn't work**

Congress has tried to patch these techniques individually — tightening GRAT rules here, limiting valuation discounts there. But:

1. **Tax lawyers innovate faster** — new techniques appear as soon as old ones are banned
2. **Complexity increases** — each patch adds more rules, more exceptions, more ways to game the system
3. **Wealthy families can always afford to fight** — \$500K in legal fees is nothing if you're saving \$50M in estate tax

The Fair & Simple Tax Act takes a different approach: **remove the foundation these techniques depend on**.

### **What do these loopholes cost?**

The magnitude of annual revenue loss from sophisticated estate planning is staggering:

| Technique | Estimated Annual Revenue Loss | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **GRATs** | \$15-25 billion | Mostly used by ultra-high-net-worth (billionaire tier) |
| **Dynasty Trusts** | \$20-40 billion | Deferred taxation across generations; concentrated in ultra-wealthy |
| **Valuation Discounts** | \$10-15 billion | Annual gift/estate tax reduction from overvalued discounts |
| **Private Foundations** | \$5-10 billion | Annual deferred capital gains + tax-favored accumulation |
| **Stepped-up Basis (all techniques)** | \$40-80 billion | The biggest single loophole: all gains erased at death |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUE LOSS** | **\$90-170 billion** | Concentrated among top 0.1% of wealth holders |

**Sources & Notes:**
* These estimates are derived from IRS studies, Treasury analyses, and academic research on estate planning behavior
* The stepped-up basis figure represents roughly **\$2-3 trillion in unrealized gains** that escape taxation annually (valued at 2-5% effective tax rate)
* Most of this benefit flows to fewer than 50,000 families (top 0.01% of wealth distribution)
* These are **conservative estimates** — actual losses may be higher, as sophisticated planning is deliberately obscured

**By comparison:**
* This \$90-170B annual loss exceeds the entire annual budget of the Department of Education (\$238B includes K-12 + higher ed, but the pure DOE discretionary budget is \$80B)
* It's equivalent to eliminating all federal spending on infrastructure, research, and development programs
* It represents roughly **2-4% of total federal revenue**, concentrated in avoidance by the ultra-wealthy

### **What would the Act recover?**

Closing these loopholes would recover **\$75-150 billion annually** in the long run, though the transition is complex:

**Years 1-5 (transition period):** \$50-75 billion/year (lower during transition)

**Years 6+:** \$100-150 billion/year (full effect as:
* First generation of estates taxed on unrealized gains at death
* Dynasty trusts can no longer defer indefinitely
* GRATs lose their zero-risk structure
* Stepped-up basis eliminated

**This revenue:**
* Is **NOT** raised by punishing typical families (who remain completely protected)
* Comes from **closing permanent tax avoidance** used exclusively by the ultra-wealthy
* Represents recovery of **revenue that has long been deferred or lost**

Without closing these loopholes, the U.S. federal government is currently running a structural deficit, with revenues roughly \$1-2 trillion below spending levels. Recovering \$100+ billion annually from wealthy families using sophisticated estate planning techniques is both:

1. **Fiscally necessary** — helps restore revenue-to-spending balance
2. **Foundationally fair** — closes techniques that are available to maybe 50,000 families globally

Without closing these loopholes, the tax burden continues to shift to the working and middle classes — who can't afford specialized tax planning and must pay their full share.

### **How the Act closes these loopholes automatically**

The Act doesn't ban GRATs or dynasty trusts or valuation discounts. Instead, it **eliminates the underlying conditions that make them work**:

#### **Death as a realization event**
* Under current law, you can hold appreciated assets your entire life and pass them to heirs with no capital gains tax ever (thanks to stepped-up basis)
* Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, **death triggers capital gains tax** using the lifetime exemption system
* GRATs, dynasty trusts, and foundations can't avoid taxation indefinitely — someone eventually pays tax on the appreciation

#### **No stepped-up basis**
* Current law lets heirs inherit assets at death-day value, erasing all prior gains
* The Act eliminates this — heirs inherit at your cost basis
* This means trusts can't accumulate gains for decades and reset the basis at each generation

#### **Lower estate tax exemption**
* Current law: \$14M per person (\$28M per couple)
* The Act: \$5M per person (\$10M per couple), with progressive rates above that
* Harder to shelter large fortunes completely from estate tax

#### **Progressive capital gains rates**
* You can't avoid tax indefinitely by never selling
* Gains eventually face 15%/20%/27%/32% rates depending on lifetime accumulation
* High-net-worth estates pay tax on unrealized gains at death

#### **The \$1.5M lifetime exemption**
* Protects typical families completely
* Shelters the first \$1.5M in lifetime gains
* Wealthy families already used their exemption long ago — dynasty trusts can't reset it

### **What this means in practice**

**For GRATs:** You can still use them, but when you die (or when the trust beneficiaries eventually realize the gains), the appreciation is taxed. No more permanent tax-free wealth transfer.

**For Dynasty Trusts:** The trust can still exist for 500 years, but each generation pays tax on distributions or sales. The compounding wealth doesn't escape taxation forever.

**For Valuation Discounts:** Even if you claim a discount for gift tax purposes, the beneficiaries inherit your original cost basis — so when they sell (or when they die), the full appreciation is taxed. The discount just delayed tax, it didn't eliminate it.

**For Private Foundations:** You still avoid capital gains on the transfer, but you already gave the asset away — your heirs don't inherit it. And the foundation must distribute 5% annually or face penalties. The Act doesn't change this much, except to eliminate the ability to use foundations as a step in dynasty wealth transfer.

### **What about legitimate family businesses?**

A common concern: "What if I've spent 40 years building a \$20M business and want to pass it to my children?"

The Fair & Simple Tax Act protects this:

* **$1.5M lifetime exemption per person** ($3M for a couple) shields the first layer of gains
* **15-year payment flexibility** for illiquid assets — no forced sales
* **Clean basis after tax is paid:** unrealized gains are realized and taxed at death, and heirs inherit assets with a **clean basis** (value at death), so they only pay tax on future gains
* **Progressive rates** — a $20M family business with $15M in gains pays modest rates (15-20%), not confiscatory rates

The difference: **a genuine family business transition is protected. A $5 billion dynasty trust using legal engineering to skip 5 generations of estate tax is not.**

### **Why this approach works better**

Instead of playing whack-a-mole with individual techniques, the Act removes the game board:

* **No free stepped-up basis** → you can't erase gains by dying; gains are taxed first, then basis resets
* **Death as realization** → can't defer forever
* **Progressive rates on lifetime gains** → can't avoid tax by never selling
* **Lower estate exemption** → can't shelter \$50M+ completely

**The result:** Ultra-wealthy families can still use trusts, foundations, and sophisticated planning. But they can't use them to **permanently avoid taxation on billions in gains**.

### **The bottom line**

These estate planning techniques started with legitimate purposes — helping families transition businesses, encouraging philanthropy, recognizing illiquid asset challenges. But they became loopholes because the tax code let you defer gains indefinitely and reset basis at death.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act doesn't ban these techniques. It just says: **at some point, someone pays tax on the appreciation**. That's not radical. It's basic fairness.

Typical families are completely protected. Ultra-wealthy families can still transfer wealth — they just can't transfer billions tax-free across 10 generations using legal engineering.

## **Q12: How do trusts work under this plan? Can I use them to avoid paying tax forever?**

**No. Trusts can still be used for estate planning, liability protection, and managing beneficiary distribution — but they cannot be used as permanent tax deferral vehicles.** Any **income or realized gains retained by a trust** are taxed to the trust at the **top marginal rate (45%)** in the year earned. **Distributions** are taxed to the beneficiary: ordinary income at ordinary rates, and capital gains under the capital gains schedule. The **$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption is per-person** and is used only by individuals — **trusts do not get their own exemption and cannot “stack” exemptions across generations.**

The current system allows wealthy families to use trusts for permanent tax deferral:

* **Dynasty trusts** accumulate income and never distribute, deferring tax indefinitely
* **Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)** transfer appreciating assets tax-free (covered in Q11)
* **Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)** use below-market loans to shift wealth
* **Perpetual trusts in some states** (like Alaska, Nevada) let assets grow tax-free across generations

Fair & Simple eliminates the tax deferral game without disrupting legitimate trust uses.

### **How trusts are taxed under Fair & Simple**

**For income or realized gains retained by the trust:**

* **Retained in trust** = Trust pays **45%** tax on that amount in the year earned
* This makes indefinite accumulation expensive, without banning trusts

**For distributions to beneficiaries:**

* **Ordinary income distributed** = Beneficiary pays ordinary income tax at their rate
* **Capital gains distributed** = Beneficiary uses their lifetime exemption, then pays capital gains rates
* **Principal (non-income) distributed** = Tax-free (it's already been taxed at some point)

**For the lifetime capital gains exemption:**

* Each person gets one $1.5M exemption (couples $3M), usable any time during life or at death
* **Exemption does not apply at the trust level, does not transfer through trusts, and does not multiply across generations**
* If you use your $1.5M exemption during life, your kids still get their own $1.5M during their life or at their death

### **Example: Family Accumulation Trust**

**Current Law:**
* You create a trust, fund it with $10M in stocks
* Trust accumulates dividends and capital gains (doesn't distribute)
* Over 30 years: Grows to $30M, gains $20M unrealized
* At your death: Heirs get step-up basis, inherit $30M tax-free
* **Tax on $20M of gains: $0**

**Under Fair & Simple:**
* You create a trust, fund it with $10M in stocks
* Trust earns $1M in annual dividends and gains
* Trust pays 45% tax ($450K) on that income each year
* Over 30 years: Trust pays ~\$13.5M in accumulated income tax
* Remaining growth ($16.5M) still taxable to heirs when distributed
* **Tax on $20M of gains: ~$13.5M + ongoing tax on distributions**

**Result:** Trust is still useful for management and liability protection, but not for tax deferral. Wealthy families can't park assets in a trust and avoid tax forever.

### **Why this closes the loophole**

**Current system:** Defer income in trust, never distribute, heirs get step-up basis, multigenerational wealth compounds tax-free.

**Fair & Simple:** 
1. Deferral is expensive (45% annual tax on retained income)
2. Free step-up basis is gone (death/distribution triggers realization and tax; basis resets only after tax is paid)
3. Exemption doesn't multiply (one per person, not per dynasty)

**Result:** Trusts are still valuable for non-tax reasons (management, creditor protection, probate avoidance), but they can't be used as permanent tax vehicles.

### **What trusts can still do**

* **Estate planning:** Distribute to heirs over time, control beneficiary access
* **Creditor protection:** Protect assets from beneficiary's creditors/litigation
* **Spendthrift provisions:** Keep beneficiary from squandering assets
* **Tax-efficient distribution:** Distribute to lower-bracket beneficiaries, but this is ordinary tax planning, not deferral

Basically: Use a trust if you want to manage how/when heirs get money, or protect assets. Don't use a trust expecting to avoid tax — that's gone.


# Part 4: Impact on Innovation & Investment


## **Q13: Doesn’t eliminating the primary residence exclusion hurt homeowners?**

**No. The lifetime capital gains exemption protects most home sales — and treats homeowners more fairly over time.**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, each individual receives a **\$1.5 million lifetime capital gains exemption** that applies to *all* long-term gains — including gains from the sale of a primary residence.

For most homeowners, this means their home sale remains completely tax-free.

### **A typical homeowner scenario**

* Bought a home for \$250,000  
* Sold years later for \$650,000  
* Total gain: \$400,000  
* Lifetime exemption used: \$400,000  
* **Tax owed: \$0**

The homeowner still has \$1.1 million of exemption remaining for future gains from investments, additional home sales, or a small business exit.

### **What if I move more than once?**

The lifetime exemption is designed to cover **multiple life events**, not just a single sale. Most households accumulate far less than \$1.5 million in total lifetime housing gains, even after several moves over decades.

This means families can buy a starter home, move for work, upsize as their family grows, and downsize later in life — all without triggering capital gains tax in most cases.

### **Why replace the current exclusion?**

The existing home sale exclusion:

* applies only to homeowners, not renters who build wealth through saving  
* encourages tax-driven housing decisions  
* requires tracking ownership and use tests

By contrast, the lifetime exemption:

* applies equally to homes, stocks, and businesses  
* rewards long-term saving regardless of asset type  
* eliminates special rules and paperwork

### **The broader principle**

Unlike the current system, which privileges housing over other forms of saving, the Fair & Simple Tax Act treats homeownership as **one important way** families build long-term security — not a tax-preferred category that distorts behavior.

**Bottom Line:**  
Most home sales remain tax-free. Families who move over time are protected. And the tax code treats homeowners and renters more fairly than it does today.

## **Q14: Why no special carried interest rule?**

Because the structure already closes it. At $100M+ in lifetime capital gains, the rate converges to 45% — the same as the top ordinary income rate — so there is no benefit to re-labeling labor income as capital gains at extreme levels.

### **The structural fix (not a carve-out)**

1. **$100M+ gains taxed at 45%.** Fund managers with very large cumulative carry hit the top capital gains bracket, which matches the top income rate. Character shifting no longer matters.
2. **Applies automatically.** Works for private equity, hedge funds, venture, and real estate funds — any profits interest paid in kind. No bespoke rules, no industry carve-outs.
3. **Simpler to enforce.** IRS does not need to police "services vs. investment" or set salary floors; it just applies the lifetime gains schedule.

### **Illustration: large PE/hedge fund manager**

Assume $200M in lifetime carried interest over a career:

* First $1.5M: $0 tax (exemption)
* Next tiers up to $100M: taxed at 15%/20%/27%/32%
* Amount over $100M: taxed at 45%

Effective rate lands in the **low 40s%** — roughly double today's ~23.8% on carried interest — without any industry-specific rulemaking.

### **Why not a salary floor + residual allowance?**

* Complex to define "services" vs. "capital" — invites gaming and endless guidance.
* Creates cliff effects and carve-outs by industry and entity type.
* The convergence tier solves the incentive directly, uniformly, and durably.

### **What about typical investors and LPs?**

* Limited partners are unchanged; this targets only the managers' profit share.
* Managers with ordinary-scale gains (<$100M lifetime) still benefit from lower capital gains rates. Once gains become dynastic in scale, the rate aligns with labor income.

**Bottom line:** The convergence tier closes carried interest by design — no special rule, no new loopholes, no industry carve-outs.

## **Q15: Will this punish entrepreneurs and innovators?**

**No. The Fair & Simple Tax Act is designed to reward long-term innovation, protect the startup ecosystem, and eliminate loopholes that distort incentives.**

America’s greatest economic advantage is its ability to turn risky ideas into world-changing companies. This Act is built around that reality — and around the fact that innovation thrives in systems that are predictable, neutral, and fair.

### **Why this strengthens, rather than weakens, innovation**

**1\. The United States remains the best place in the world to build a company.**  
The Act preserves low taxes on long-term investment, a generous lifetime capital gains exemption, and clear, predictable rules. For the vast majority of founders, effective tax rates on exits are **lower than or comparable to current law**, without relying on fragile carve-outs.

The goal is not to penalize success — it is to remove uncertainty so founders can focus on building, not tax planning.

**2\. Patient, high-risk capital is still favored.**  
Founders and early investors who hold equity for the long term continue to benefit from capital gains treatment and the lifetime exemption. Short-term trading is taxed as income; long-term company building is rewarded.

This reinforces the same time horizons that venture capital already depends on.

**3\. The QSBS loophole is replaced with something better, not nothing.**  
QSBS helped some founders, but it was narrow, complex, and arbitrarily structured. Many legitimate startups and investors never qualified.

The Act replaces QSBS with a **simple, universal rule** that applies to all companies and all founders, regardless of industry, structure, or legal form.

That is a win for innovation, not a loss.

### **What about QSBS?**

Let's be direct: QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) is a valuable benefit for some founders today, and yes, **some successful exits will pay more tax under the Fair & Simple Tax Act**. But it's worth understanding what QSBS actually does — and who it leaves behind.

**What QSBS provides today:**

* **100% exclusion** on capital gains from selling qualified small business stock
* Capped at the greater of **\$10 million** or **10x your original investment**
* Requires: C-corporation structure, held 5+ years, under \$50M in assets at issuance, active business (not passive holding company)

**Who QSBS excludes:**

* **LLCs, S-corps, and partnerships** — even if they're building innovative companies
* **Restaurants, hotels, farms** — specifically excluded industries
* **Professional services** — law, accounting, consulting, medicine
* **Financial services and real estate** — also excluded
* **Second and third companies** — founders who build multiple businesses face complexity and gaming around stacking \$10M exemptions

**A concrete comparison: \$20M founder exit**

Let's take a founder who starts with \$100K in stock and exits at \$20M after 7 years (a successful outcome, but not a mega-exit).

**Today with QSBS:**
* First \$10M of gain: **\$0 tax** (100% excluded)
* Remaining \$10M of gain: ~20% federal capital gains = **\$2M tax**
* **Total tax: \$2M**
* **Founder keeps: \$18M (90%)**

**Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act:**
* Lifetime exemption: \$1.5M → **\$0 tax**
* Next \$7M of gain: 15% = **\$1.05M**
* Next \$11.5M of gain: 20% = **\$2.3M**
* **Total tax: \$3.35M**
* **Founder keeps: \$16.65M (83%)**

**The honest answer:** Yes, that's **\$1.35M more in tax**. But the founder still keeps **\$16.65 million** — enough to be financially secure for life, start another company, or invest in the next generation of founders.

**Why the universal system is better:**

1. **It applies to everyone.** The LLC founder building a restaurant tech company gets the same \$1.5M exemption as the C-corp SaaS founder. The real estate entrepreneur gets the same treatment as the biotech founder. No arbitrary industry exclusions.

2. **It's predictable and simple.** You don't need specialized tax counsel to figure out if you qualify. You don't need to structure your company a certain way just for QSBS. You don't need to game the system with multiple entities.

3. **It rewards all innovation, not just venture-backed C-corps.** The fastest-growing segment of American entrepreneurship is outside traditional VC channels. Why should a founder building a \$50M service business in an 'excluded' industry get zero benefit while a comparable SaaS founder gets \$10M tax-free?

4. **It scales progressively.** QSBS has a hard cliff at \$10M (or 10x basis). Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, rates rise gradually as lifetime gains increase — no sudden jumps, no gaming around the cap.

5. **It eliminates wealth transfer games.** Today, sophisticated founders structure QSBS to pass gains to family members, use multiple entities, or time transactions around the cap. The lifetime exemption system eliminates this complexity.

**The bottom line on QSBS:**

If you're a founder building the next billion-dollar company, you're going to be extraordinarily wealthy under either system. The question is whether we build a tax code around **fragile, gameable carve-outs that only help some founders** — or a **simple, universal system that treats all innovation equally**.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act chooses the latter. Most founders — especially those outside traditional tech — come out ahead. And yes, some mega-exits pay modestly more. But in exchange, we get a system that's fair, predictable, and built to last.

**4\. Extreme outcomes are treated differently — deliberately.**  
The Act asks more only when lifetime gains reach levels that are extraordinarily rare and highly concentrated. These adjustments are modest, predictable, and well below top labor income rates.

This reflects a basic principle: America should reward extraordinary success, but not build a tax code that depends on it being completely untaxed.

**5\. Innovation depends on systems, not carve-outs.**  
Breakthroughs happen in ecosystems — universities, infrastructure, talent pipelines, and deep capital markets. A simpler, more durable tax system strengthens those foundations, which matter more to long-term innovation than any single exemption.

**Bottom line:**  
The Fair & Simple Tax Act protects ambition, rewards risk-taking, and preserves America’s innovation edge — while ensuring that the system works for decades rather than depending on fragile loopholes.


## **Q16: What about expatriation and capital flight?**

**Renouncing citizenship triggers the same rule as death: a mark-to-market tax on all gains, with the lifetime exemption and progressive capital gains rates.**

### **How the exit tax works**
- All appreciated assets are marked to market on the departure date; remaining lifetime exemption applies first.
- Gains above the exemption are taxed at 15%/20%/27%/32% based on total lifetime gains.
- Illiquid assets get 15-year payment flexibility to avoid forced sales.
- Covered expatriate rules continue to apply; returns within 10 years can trigger collection.

### **Enforcement and leakage controls**
- Uses existing reporting (FATCA/FBAR), beneficial ownership rules, and bank reporting on large transfers.
- Departure bonds and treaty information-sharing can be required for high-net-worth departures.
- Proceeds are hard to hide if they are ever moved into the formal financial system or used in developed markets.

### **Scale of the risk**
- A few thousand people renounce annually; only a minority are tax-motivated and fewer still can successfully hide proceeds long term.
- Even with some evasion, the leakage is small relative to the revenue recovered from closing other loopholes.

**Bottom line:** Departure is taxed as if assets were sold. Payment relief prevents fire sales, existing reporting makes evasion difficult, and the fiscal risk is limited.


## **Appendix A: Revenue Model**

### **Executive Summary**

The American Tax Fairness Act is **revenue-positive from Day 1**, raising $200–310B annually by closing loopholes that currently allow ultra-wealthy families to avoid taxation indefinitely. The plan requires no new taxes on ordinary income—it simply collects taxes that the current system lets slip through.

### **Current Federal Revenue Baseline (\~\$4.5T)**

| Source | Current Revenue |
| :---- | :---- |
| Individual Income Tax | \$2.2T |
| Payroll Tax (FICA) | \$1.5T |
| Corporate Tax | \$420B |
| Estate/Gift Tax | \$35B |
| Other | \$345B |

### **Costs (Revenue We Lose)**

| Change | Annual Cost | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Elimination of AMT and NIIT | \-\$30–40B | Simpler tax code; complexity savings offset some revenue loss |
| Child benefits consolidation | \-\$20–30B | Consolidates CTC/EITC/Childcare (current: \$276B) into \$4,000/child with phase-out (\$220B cost) |
| **Total Annual Costs** | **\-\$50–70B** | |

### **Gains (Revenue We Add)**

| Change | Annual Revenue | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 45% top bracket ($1.5M+ Single / $3M+ MFJ) | \+\$40–60B | Applies to ~0.1% of taxpayers; AMT/NIIT elimination simplifies compliance |
| Capital gains: progressive rates above $1.5M exemption | \+\$50–80B | 6-tier lifetime system; protects small gains, taxes large accumulations |
| Stepped-up basis eliminated at death | \+\$75–100B | Unrealized gains taxed at death using lifetime exemption |
| Buy-borrow-die closed (asset-backed borrowing rule) | \+\$25–50B | Deemed sale when appreciated assets secure loans |
| QSBS eliminated; replaced with universal $1.5M exemption | \+\$10–20B | All founders/investors get same exemption; no more $10M+ exclusions |
| Estate tax reform (\$14M → \$5M exemption) | \+\$50–65B | ~30K estates taxed vs. ~4K currently |
| ROTH reforms (contribution cap, $2.5M freeze, death = realization) | \+\$15–25B | Closes "Peter Thiel loophole" while expanding access |

*Note on scoring:* These line-item estimates overlap. For example, “death as realization,” “no step-up,” and “buy-borrow-die” often apply to the same deferred gains in different circumstances. The totals above should be read as an **interaction-adjusted range**, not a simple sum of independent policies.

| **Total Annual Gains** | **\+\$265–400B** | |

---

### **Net Position Summary**

| Scenario | Annual Costs | Annual Gains | Net |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Conservative | \-\$70B | \+\$265B | **\+\$195B** |
| Mid | \-\$60B | \+\$333B | **\+\$273B** |
| Optimistic | \-\$50B | \+\$400B | **\+\$350B** |

**Conclusion:** The American Tax Fairness Act is solidly revenue-positive from Day 1, raising $200–310B annually by closing loopholes that allow ultra-wealthy families to avoid taxation. These gains fund the expanded child benefit and simplified AMT/NIIT elimination with substantial surplus for deficit reduction.

## **Tax Burden by Income Percentile**

This table shows the distributional impact of the Fair & Simple Tax Act across income levels, demonstrating that the reform is **progressive** — most households pay less or about the same, while high earners contribute more.

### **Household Tax Impact by Income Percentile**

| Income Percentile | Representative Income | Current Effective Rate | Fair & Simple Rate | Change | Annual $ Change | Who Wins/Loses |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bottom 20%** | \$25,000 | 10.5% | 8.2% | -2.3% | **-\$575** | ✓ Wins |
| **20-40%** | \$45,000 | 14.8% | 12.5% | -2.3% | **-\$1,035** | ✓ Wins |
| **40-60%** | \$75,000 | 17.2% | 15.8% | -1.4% | **-\$1,050** | ✓ Wins |
| **60-80%** | \$125,000 | 19.5% | 18.9% | -0.6% | **-\$750** | ✓ Wins |
| **80-90%** | \$200,000 | 21.8% | 21.5% | -0.3% | **-\$600** | ✓ ~Even |
| **90-95%** | \$300,000 | 23.5% | 24.2% | +0.7% | **+\$2,100** | Pays more |
| **95-99%** | \$500,000 | 26.2% | 28.5% | +2.3% | **+\$11,500** | Pays more |
| **Top 1% (99-99.9%)** | \$1.5M | 28.5% | 32.8% | +4.3% | **+\$64,500** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.1%** | \$5M | 29.8% | 35.2% | +5.4% | **+\$270,000** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.01%** | \$25M | 23.1% | 37.5% | +14.4% | **+\$3.6M** | Pays dramatically more |

*Note: Current effective rates include FICA, federal income tax, and account for common deductions/loopholes. Fair & Simple rates include ESNC (employer-side only) and income tax with no loopholes.*

### **Key Findings**

**80% of households pay less or about the same:**
- Bottom 80% with children see modest savings from expanded child benefit
- Primary drivers: $4K/child benefit expansion

**Top 20% split:**
- 80-90th percentile (~even): Modest changes
- 90-99th percentile (pays more): Higher brackets + fewer deductions
- Top 1% (pays significantly more): Loophole closures + progressive capital gains

**The Top 0.01% sees the largest increase:**
- Currently effective rate: 23.1% (due to stepped-up basis, carried interest, estate planning)
- Fair & Simple rate: 37.5%
- Increase: +14.4 percentage points
- **This is where the revenue comes from** — closing loopholes that only ultra-wealthy can access

### **Revenue Composition by Income Group**

| Income Group | Share of Total Income | Current Tax Share | Fair & Simple Tax Share | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bottom 50% | 12% | 3% | 2% | -1% |
| 50-90% | 38% | 30% | 28% | -2% |
| 90-99% | 32% | 38% | 40% | +2% |
| Top 1% | 18% | 29% | 30% | +1% |

**Result:** The system becomes slightly more progressive. The bottom 90% contributes less as a share of total revenue, while the top 10% contributes more.

### **Political Messaging**

✓ **"80% of Americans will pay less or about the same"**  
✓ **"Middle-class families save \$750-\$1,000/year"**  
✓ **"Billionaires can't dodge taxes anymore — they'll pay their fair share"**  
✓ **"We're closing loopholes, not raising taxes on working families"**

### **Why the Top 0.01% Currently Pay Only 23%**

The ultra-wealthy avoid taxes through:
1. **Stepped-up basis** — \$75-100B/year never taxed
2. **Buy-borrow-die** — Live on loans, never realize gains
3. **Carried interest** — Compensation taxed as capital gains
4. **Dynasty trusts** — Wealth compounds tax-free across generations
5. **Estate planning** — GRATs, FLPs, valuation discounts

Fair & Simple eliminates ALL of these loopholes, which is why their effective rate nearly doubles.

**Bottom line:** This plan generates immediate revenue from loophole closures. Future simplification phases (pre-filled returns, elimination of itemized deductions, automated compliance) will unlock additional benefits through government efficiency, reduced deadweight loss, and improved tax gap collection.

| [Small Biz + Professional Spouse](#26-small-business-owner--professional-spouse--the-thompsons-400k-combined) | $400K | 16.6% | 25.1% | **+8.5%** |

**The Pattern:**

* **Families with children:** Modest wins from expanded \$4K/child benefit  
* **High earners:** Similar taxes, but simpler (AMT eliminated)  
* **Capital gains under \$1.5M:** Tax-free (lifetime exemption)  
* **Small to large exits:** QSBS eliminated; replaced with universal \$1.5M lifetime exemption, then 15-25% brackets  
* **Mega exits:** Carried interest loophole closed; roughly same effective rate but more transparent  
* **Inheritance:** Pay significantly more (stepped-up basis eliminated)

**Bottom line:** ATFA delivers meaningful relief to working families while closing loopholes that let extreme wealth avoid taxation across generations.

*Phase 1 uses current law brackets. At \$600K, David is below the \$1.5M threshold for the new 45% bracket. AMT elimination simplifies his filing.*

**David's take:** "My tax stays about the same, but no more AMT calculations. The simplicity alone is worth it."

#### **10\. Mega Exit — Hedge Fund Founder, \$500M Exit**

|  | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Exit Proceeds | \$500,000,000 | \$500,000,000 | — |

#### **11\. Trust Fund Heir — Inherits \$20M**

**Decedent's situation:**

* Total estate: \$20M  
* Cost basis: \$5M  
* Unrealized gain: \$15M  
* Lifetime cap gains exemption: Never used (\$1.5M remaining)

**Step 1: Capital Gains at Death**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Unrealized Gain | \$15,000,000 |
| Lifetime Exemption Remaining | \-\$1,500,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$13,500,000 |
| Tax: 15% on \$1.5M | \$225,000 |
| Tax: 20% on \$7M | \$1,400,000 |
| Tax: 25% on \$3.5M | \$875,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$2,500,000** |

**Step 2: Estate Tax**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Gross Estate | \$20,000,000 |
| Less: Cap Gains Tax Paid | \-\$2,500,000 |
| Net Estate | \$17,500,000 |
| Less: Estate Exemption | \-\$5,000,000 |
| Taxable Estate | \$12,500,000 |
| Estate Tax (40%) | **\$5,000,000** |

**Total Taxes at Death:** \$2,500,000 \+ \$5,000,000 \= **\$7,500,000**

**Heir Receives:** \$20,000,000 \- \$7,500,000 \= **\$12,500,000**

**Effective Tax Rate on Estate:** 37.5%

**Comparison to Current Law:**

* Current: Step-up eliminates cap gains, \$14M exemption covers estate \= **\$0 tax**  
* Fair & Simple: **\$7.5M tax**

**The heir's take:** "I'm still inheriting \$12.5 million dollars. My parents paid taxes on their gains like everyone else. That's fair."

#### **12. Dual-Income Professional Couple — The Andersons, \$300K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Both work in tech (W-2 employees)
* Combined income: \$300,000
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids
* Mortgage interest: \$20K, state taxes: \$15K
* **Lifetime exemption status:** \$3M available (couple, no capital gains yet)

**Current Law (with SALT deduction):**
* FICA: \$23,000
* Federal income tax: \~\$42,000 (after SALT deduction)
* **Total tax: \~\$65,000 (\~21.7% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Gross Income | \$300,000 | \$300,000 | — |
| Employee FICA (7.65%) | \$23,000 | \$0 | -\$23,000 |
| Federal Income Tax | \$42,000 | \$67,000 | +\$25,000 |
| Child Tax Credit | -$4,000 | -$5,000 | -\$1,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **\$61,000** | **\$62,000** | **+\$1,000** |
| **Effective Rate** | **20.3%** | **20.7%** | **+0.4%** |

*Fair & Simple income tax (MFJ): 5% × \$40K + 15% × \$80K + 27% × \$180K \= \$2K + \$12K + \$48.6K \= \$62.6K*

**The Andersons' take:** "We pay about \$1,000 more, but we keep the FICA savings and our taxes take 15 minutes instead of hiring a CPA."

---

#### **13. High-Earning Dual-Income Couple — The Patel-Johnsons, \$500K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Both are corporate executives (W-2)
* Combined income: \$500,000
* Married filing jointly + 3 kids
* **Lifetime exemption status:** \$3M available (couple, no capital gains yet)

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Employee FICA | $24,000 | $24,000 | $0 |
| Federal Income Tax | $95,000 | $95,000 | $0 |
| Child Tax Credit | -$0 | -$0 | $0 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **$119,000** | **$119,000** | **$0** |
| **Effective Rate** | **23.8%** | **23.8%** | **0%** |

*Fair & Simple income tax (MFJ): Brackets unchanged except for new 45% top rate. No child credit at $500K. FICA unchanged.*

**The Patel-Johnsons' take**: "Our total tax is about the same as under current law, since the child credit phases out and the brackets are unchanged except at the very top."


---

#### **26. Small Business Owner + Professional Spouse — The Thompsons, \$400K Combined**

**Situation:**
* Sarah owns a small retail business (S-Corp): \$200K profit
  * Takes \$80K W-2 salary, \$120K distributions
* Mike is a software engineer (W-2): \$200K salary
* Married filing jointly + 2 kids

**Current Law:**
* Sarah: \$80K salary (FICA \~\$12K) + \$120K distributions
* Mike: \$200K salary (FICA \~\$15.3K)
* Combined income tax: \~\$43K
* **Total tax: \~\$70K (17.5% effective rate)**

| | Current Law | Fair & Simple | Change |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|
| FICA + ESNC | $27,300 | $27,300 | $0 |
| Federal Income Tax | $43,000 | $43,000 | $0 |
| Child Tax Credit | -$4,000 | -$0 | +$4,000 |
| **Total Federal Tax** | **$66,300** | **$70,300** | **+$4,000** |
| **Effective Rate** | **16.6%** | **17.6%** | **+1.0%** |

*Fair & Simple:*
- *Sarah's ESNC: 8% × $80K salary = $6,400 (distributions avoid ESNC)*
- *Mike's FICA: $20,900 (7.65% of $200K)*
- *Combined income tax at ordinary brackets (no QBI): ~$43K*
- *No child credit at $400K (phased out)*
- *Total: $6,400 + $20,900 + $43,000 = $70,300*

**The Thompsons' take:** "We pay about $4,000 more than under current law, mainly due to the loss of the QBI deduction and child credit phase-out."


## **Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability**

### **The Honest Assessment: ATFA is a Great Start — But Only a Start**

The American Tax Fairness Act is **a major step forward**, generating \$200-310B annually through loophole closures. But let's be clear: **it's not the whole solution.** This Act tackles the revenue side of the fiscal gap. Congress must now match that effort on the spending side — with the same principles of simplicity, fairness, and durability.

---

#### **The Fiscal Gap in Plain Numbers**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | \~\$1.7T (\~6% of GDP) | \~\$840B-1.12T (3-4% of GDP) | \~\$580-860B annually |
| **Over 10 Years** | \~\$17T of deficit | \~\$8.4T-11.2T sustainable | Need to reduce by \~$5.8T-8.6T |

**What "sustainable" means:** Economists broadly agree that deficits of 3-4% of GDP are manageable long-term, especially if combined with steady GDP growth. Going from 6% to 3-4% of GDP is a major achievement, not requiring elimination of the entire deficit.

**This Act's contribution:** \$200-310B annually (\~$2-3T over 10 years)  
**This Act's share of the gap:** Roughly 23-53% of what needs closing (or about one-quarter to one-half)  
**Still needed:** \$230-720B annually in additional revenue and/or spending reform (\~$2.3-7.2T over 10 years)

**Bottom line:** We've built a strong foundation. Now we need the walls and roof.

---

### **The Fiscal Strategy: Three Tracks**

Achieving fiscal sustainability requires coordinated action across three dimensions:

#### **Track 1: Revenue Reform (This Act) — \$200-310B annually**

✓ **Close extreme wealth loopholes:** Stepped-up basis, buy-borrow-die, carried interest, dynasty trusts  
✓ **Progressive capital gains:** Ultra-wealthy pay normal income tax rates on investment income  
✓ **Broaden the base:** Eliminate QBI deduction, uncap Social Security payroll tax  
✓ **Simplify the code:** Reduce compliance burden, improve compliance  

**What this does:** Asks the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share while keeping rates reasonable on everyone else.

---

#### **Track 2: Spending Reform (Partner legislation) — \$230-720B annually**

The same principles should guide spending reform:

**Simplicity:**
- Consolidate 80\+ overlapping workforce programs into 5-10 consolidated initiatives
- Merge 40\+ housing programs into a unified housing policy
- Streamline outdated agencies and authorizations (many from the 1970s-80s)
- Modernize federal IT infrastructure (eliminate fraud, reduce waste)

**Fairness:**
- Means-test Medicare and Social Security for high earners (benefits phased above $250K+ combined income)
- Eliminate corporate subsidies (agricultural supports, energy credits, etc.)
- Reform spending disproportionately favoring wealthy (e.g., federal flood insurance in expensive coastal areas)

**Durability:**
- Address entitlement growth curves through targeted reforms, not across-the-board cuts
- Reform defense procurement waste (improving efficiency, not cutting capability)
- Index benefit programs to inflation automatically to prevent ad-hoc budgeting crisis
- Create a **bipartisan fiscal commission with enforcement teeth** (not another advisory body)

**Realistic savings potential:**

| Category | Potential Annual Savings | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Entitlement reforms (means-testing, better fraud detection) | \$150-300B | Does not cut benefits for middle class; focuses on high-income beneficiaries |
| Defense procurement efficiency | \$40-80B | Reduces waste without reducing capability |
| Program consolidation (reduce duplication) | \$80-150B | 80\+ programs → 10; 40\+ housing programs → 1 |
| Federal IT modernization | \$20-40B | Modern systems reduce fraud and improve service delivery |
| Interest savings (deficit reduction) | \$100-300B | Compounding effect as deficit shrinks over 10 years |
| **Total Potential Annual Savings** | **\$390-870B** | Combined with revenue reform: \$590B-1.18T annually |

**Why this is realistic:** Every major audit of federal spending (GAO, OMB) identifies \$200-400B annually in waste, fraud, and duplication. We're identifying those items, not creating new cuts.

---

#### **Track 3: GDP Growth (Natural tail wind) — Reduces deficit as % of GDP**

At 2-3% nominal GDP growth, the deficit automatically shrinks as a percentage of GDP:

| Year | Nominal GDP | 6% Deficit | 4% Deficit (target) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Today | \$28T | \$1.68T | \$1.12T |
| Year 5 | \$36T | \$2.16T | \$1.44T |
| Year 10 | \$42T | \$2.52T | \$1.68T |

**The insight:** If we hold the deficit *constant* at \$1.12T in absolute dollars while GDP grows to \$42T, we've reduced the deficit burden from 6% to 2.7% of GDP — *even better than the 3-4% target.*

Revenue reform + spending reform + growth = a fiscal path that actually works.

---

### **The Political Case: Meeting in the Middle**

This Act represents what serious tax reform looks like. **Now Congress must deliver serious spending reform.**

**What this means:**
- **Conservatives:** Revenues are on the table. We've made our contribution. Now spending reform is your responsibility.
- **Progressives:** We've protected working families. No middle-class tax increases. The system is fairer. Now spending priorities should be rebalanced toward efficiency and fairness.
- **Both sides:** We've demonstrated Congress can tackle hard problems. Spending reform is the next hard problem.

**What we do NOT support:**
- VAT or broad-based consumption taxes **before comprehensive spending reform is attempted**
- Raising rates on the middle class
- Eliminating the standard deduction or child benefits
- Creating new taxes to fund new government programs
- Across-the-board benefit cuts without means-testing reform first

**What we DO support:**
- Bipartisan commission on spending reform with enforcement mechanism (not another study group)
- Consolidation of duplicative programs
- Means-testing benefits for high earners
- Defense procurement reform (efficiency, not readiness)
- Modernized federal IT infrastructure

---

### **Phased Implementation: How We Get to Fiscal Sustainability**

#### **ATFA (Years 1-3): American Tax Fairness Act**

✓ Pass into law; effective immediately  
✓ Revenue-positive from Day 1: \$200-310B annually  
✓ Simplifies tax code (fewer loopholes, clearer rules)  
✓ Demonstrates bipartisan capacity to tackle hard problems  
✓ **Deficit impact:** Reduces deficit by \$200-310B annually (1.2-1.8% of GDP reduction)

---

#### **Phase 2 (Years 2-5): Spending Reform + Simplification Launches**

**Spending side:**
- Enact bipartisan spending reform package (\$230-720B annual savings)
- Apply same principles: simplicity, fairness, durability
- Commission has enforcement mechanism (special budget procedures to prevent future drift)

**Tax side (automatic benefits from Phase 1 setup):**
- IRS moves to pre-filled returns (\$5-10B government savings annually)
- Itemized deduction elimination (scheduled for Year 3, generates \$15-25B compliance gains)
- Pass-through business simplification (no more QBI, reasonable salary debates)
- Automated wage/capital gains matching (closes tax gap: \$50-100B annually)

**Combined deficit impact:** Phase 1 \$200-310B + Spending reform \$230-720B + Tax gap closure \$50-100B = **\$480B-1.13T annually**

**Deficit reduction:** From 6% of GDP toward 3-4% of GDP

---

#### **Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Additional Tax Architecture**

If Phase 1 + Phase 2 + GDP growth have reduced deficit to 4-5% of GDP range, Phase 3 would address:

- **Social Security sustainability:** Gradual benefit formula adjustments, payroll tax increases above cap
- **Deductions reform:** Consider broader deduction limits (mortgage interest, charitable contributions)
- **Rate optimization:** Potential modest rate adjustments if needed (but with simplified base = lower-bracket rates possible)
- **Savings account unification:** Consolidate 401k/IRA/HSA rules into unified "lifetime savings accounts"

**This phase is contingent:** If Phases 1-2 have successfully reduced the deficit to sustainable levels, Phase 3 refinements become optional optimization, not urgent necessity.

---

### **Why This Sequencing Matters**

**Phase 1 first** because:
- Loophole closures are defensible on fairness and sustainability grounds
- Revenue is immediate (not dependent on future legislation)
- Simplification reduces compliance burden while improving fairness

**Phase 2 parallel** because:
- Spending reform must happen; can't rely only on revenue
- Bipartisan commission should be established Year 1 (takes years to build consensus)
- Tax simplification infrastructure (pre-filed returns, automated matching) takes 2-3 years to implement

**Phase 3 optional** because:
- Only needed if Phases 1-2 don't achieve fiscal stability
- Designed as refinement, not as core revenue source
- More time for analysis and consensus-building

**Together:** A credible path to 3-4% deficit within 5-10 years without draconian cuts or massive middle-class tax increases.

---

### **For Those Who Ask: "What Other Revenue Raising Options Are There?"**

Congress will have spending reform options ranging from modest (program consolidation, waste elimination) to aggressive (major entitlement reform). If all reasonable spending reform options are exhausted, the simplified tax base makes emergency revenue measures straightforward:

| Emergency Option | Annual Revenue | Trade-offs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Carbon Tax** (\$50-75/ton) | \+\$100-200B | Regressive without rebates; environmental co-benefit |
| **Financial Transaction Tax** (0.1%) | \+\$50-100B | May reduce market liquidity; affects retirement savers |
| **Payroll Tax Increase** (8% → 9%) | \+\$150B | Slows wage growth; employer burden |
| **Corporate Rate** (25% → 28%) | \+\$60-100B | Reduces competitiveness; tax avoidance risk |
| **VAT** (8-10%) | \+\$800B-1T | Extremely regressive; requires massive rebate system |

**Why we list these:** Transparency and credibility. We're not pretending the problem goes away. But these options should only be considered *after* spending reform is exhausted, not as first resort.

---

### **The Bottom Line**

**This Act handles the revenue side:** \$200-310B annually, closing 15-25% of the fiscal gap. The ultra-wealthy close loopholes; working families get simpler taxes and expanded benefits.

**Congress must handle the spending side:** \$230-720B in annual savings through consolidation, means-testing, and waste elimination — the same principles that guided tax reform.

**Together, plus GDP growth:** A credible path to fiscal sustainability (3-4% deficit) within 5-10 years.

**That's not just policy. That's partnership. That's how you actually solve this problem.**

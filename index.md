These proposals below are intentionally written in an [Amazon-style "Working Backwards" PR-FAQ format](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes) by [Matt Sly](https://wwww.mattsly.com). I spent much of my career in technology and product development and wrote many such documents. The format is an effective way to present new ideas, establish clear design tenets, and make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit.

As a major caveat - I am not a career policy professional. I’m a quasi-retired software entrepreneur. I am approaching the U.S. tax code as a product that has accumulated complexity over decades without a clear owner and is not serving its customers well. My goal is to help “refactor” the tax code by simplifying where possible, reducing the hidden costs of complexity and edge cases, and making fiscal tradeoffs legible to both policymakers and the public.

Each proposal can be enacted independently, but they are designed together and can be calibrated as part of a single fiscal system.

The Fair and Simple Tax Act is a series of indepedant but thematically related proposals to refactor the U.S. tax code based on three fundamental tenets. These tenets will be referenced throughout, and are included in each independant proposal.

## Proposals

#### [Phase 1: Income Tax Reform](phase_1_income_tax_reform_pr_faq.md) Eliminate loopholes and complexity, introduce new top bracket, universal child credit, and a **Lifetime Tax-Free Capital Gains Allowance** with a lifetime rate table. 

#### [Phase 2: Social Security Modernization](phase_2_social_security_modernization_pr_faq.md): Restore solvency and protect current and future retirees.

#### Phase 3: American Opportunity Accounts (Coming Soon)

## Fiscal Sustainability Summary

This project is designed to be additive across phases, but it does not replace the need for spending reform.

### **Current Fiscal Baseline (Illustrative)**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | ~\$1.7T (~6% of GDP) | ~\$840B–1.14T (3–4% of GDP) | ~\$600B–1.12T annually |
| **Over 10 Years** | ~\$17T of deficit | ~\$8.4T–11.4T sustainable | Need to reduce by ~$6.0T–11.2T |

### **Project Impact (Illustrative Annual)**

| Component | Annual Impact | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1** | **\$200–310B** | Base‑broadening and loophole closure |
| **Phase 2** | **\$310–350B** | Long‑run Social Security gap reduction (steady‑state, illustrative) |
| **Interest Savings** | **\$20–50B (near‑term)** | Scales over time with debt avoided and rates |

### **What Remains**

On optimistic assumptions, Phase 1 + Phase 2 + interest savings can close most (or even all) of the near‑term deficit gap. On conservative assumptions, a meaningful gap remains, so **targeted spending cuts and modernization** are still likely needed.

*Note:* Interest savings are small in the early years and grow as avoided debt accumulates. A simple rule of thumb is **interest savings ≈ cumulative debt avoided × average interest rate**.
Example (10‑year, 4%): avoiding $6T of cumulative borrowing implies roughly **$240B/year** in interest savings once fully phased in.

# **Press Release**

### **A radically simplified tax code that supports upward mobility and puts the nation on a path toward a balanced budget**

**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The U.S. tax code has grown so complex that it has become a black box. Most Americans are left 'you owe what you owe' without any clear understanding of how policy choices translate into real costs, benefits, or tradeoffs.

It’s 2025\. We can do better.

Today, bipartisan leaders introduced the Fair & Simple Tax Act, a comprehensive reform built on a straightforward idea: the tax system should be simple enough for ordinary citizens to understand and transparent enough to support honest democratic debate.

### **Why simplicity matters**

A simpler tax code isn’t just about convenience — it’s about democracy.

When tax rules are opaque, public debate breaks down. Citizens can’t meaningfully weigh the costs and benefits of government programs if the revenue system itself is incomprehensible. Complexity becomes a substitute for consent.

By dramatically simplifying the tax code and making it understandable to anyone, the Fair & Simple Tax Act restores transparency. With fewer moving parts and fewer hidden rules, Americans can once again have productive conversations about shared priorities — what we want government to do, and what we are willing to pay for it.

The current Internal Revenue Code spans 2,600 pages of statute and 10,000 pages of Treasury regulations. The Fair & Simple Tax Act reduces this to fewer than 200 pages — a 95% reduction in complexity.

### **What this bill does**

No family earning under \$400,000 pays more. The reform is designed so that no household earning under \$400,000 faces a higher federal tax bill than under current law.

Payroll taxes are simplified and made transparent. Employee‑side payroll taxes are removed. Social Security and Medicare are funded through a single, clearly labeled employer contribution. Workers see their full earnings directly, and benefits remain unchanged.

Saving becomes understandable. More than a dozen overlapping savings programs are replaced with one simple, universal account — flexible enough for all life stages, from education to homeownership to retirement.

Families receive clear, automatic support. Three child‑related programs become a single \$2,500 annual benefit per child, delivered automatically without paperwork or phase‑outs.

Major loopholes are closed. The special rules that allow extreme wealth to avoid taxation — including stepped‑up basis at death, QSBS, NIIT, and buy‑borrow‑die strategies — are eliminated and replaced with a single, consistent system built around a lifetime capital gains exemption that applies uniformly across all asset types.

Tax filing becomes simple, automated, and largely hands‑off. Everyone still files a tax return, but for most Americans it is pre‑filled automatically. You log in, review the information, make changes if needed, and confirm — no complex forms, schedules, or professional preparation required.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces a black box with a system people can see, understand, and debate.

### **What supporters are saying**

'This bill cuts through decades of complexity and replaces it with a system people can actually understand. A tax code this simple makes it harder to hide special favors and easier to hold the government accountable.'

— *Senior Democratic Senator*

'For too long, we’ve had a tax system that rewards lawyers and lobbyists instead of work, saving, and investment. This reform broadens the base, closes loopholes, and puts us on a more sustainable fiscal path.'

— *Senior Republican Senator*

'I don’t have a complicated tax situation — just a job, kids, and a mortgage. The idea that I could see my taxes clearly and not need an accountant every year is huge.'

— *Middle‑class parent, Ohio*

'As a small business owner, I want to spend time growing my company, not navigating tax rules. Fewer accounts, clearer rates, and no surprise carve‑outs would be a real improvement.'

— *Small business owner, Arizona*

# **Tenets**

1. **Radical Simplicity**: If a rule cannot be automated or clearly explained to a normal taxpayer, it does not belong in the tax code.  
2. **Fuel the Climb**: The system should help families build stability and wealth over time — not reward financial engineering or entrenched dynastic wealth that concentrates power across generations.  
3. **Fiscal Durability**: The reform holds the line on deficits, closes avoidance, and creates a tax base that actually collects what it is owed.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## **Part 1: The Big Picture**

## **Q1: What does the Fair & Simple Tax Act actually change?**

The Act replaces a sprawling, exception-ridden tax code with a simpler structure built around five core reforms:

### **1\. Income Taxes: Fewer Brackets, Clear Rates**

| Single Filer | Married Filing Jointly | Rate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \$0 – \$20,000 | \$0 – \$40,000 | 5% |
| \$20,000 – \$60,000 | \$40,000 – \$120,000 | 15% |
| \$60,000 – \$200,000 | \$120,000 – \$400,000 | 27% |
| \$200,000 – \$300,000 | \$400,000 – \$600,000 | 38% |
| \$300,000 – \$400,000 | \$600,000 – \$800,000 | 40% |
| \$400,000+ | \$800,000+ | 45% |

### **2\. Payroll Taxes: Immediate Relief for Workers**

* **Employee payroll tax (7.65%): Eliminated**  
* **Employer contribution:** Replaced with an 8% Employer Safety Net Contribution  
* **Self-employed:** Flat 8% rate (down from 15.3%)

Social Security and Medicare remain fully funded. Benefits do not change.

### **3\. Capital Gains: Simple, Progressive, and Fair**

* **\$1.5M lifetime exemption per person**  
* Progressive rates above the exemption (15% from \$1.5M–\$3M, 20% from \$3M–\$10M, 27% from \$10M–\$50M, 32% above \$50M)
* Same rules for homes, stocks, and businesses  
* Step-up in basis eliminated  
* Short-term gains (held less than one year) are taxed as income

(See Q7 for details.)

### **4\. Family Benefits: Automatic and Universal**

* **\$2,500 per child per year**  
* Automatically delivered  
* Fully refundable  
* No income limits or phase-outs

### **5\. Savings: One Account, Not Fifteen**

* **American Savings Account (ASA):** one universal account for all life stages

(See Q8 for details.)

---

## **Q2: How much simpler is this really?**

**95% simpler by page count.**

The current tax code:

* Internal Revenue Code: 2,600 pages
* Treasury Regulations: 10,000 pages
* Industry compilations (with annotations): 70,000+ pages

The Fair & Simple Tax Act:

* Core provisions: ~200 pages
* With transition rules: ~300-500 pages maximum

**What gets eliminated:**

* Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
* Phase-outs and income cliffs
* Itemized deductions (mortgage interest, SALT, charitable)
* 15+ retirement account types
* Dozens of credits and carve-outs (QSBS, carried interest, NIIT, etc.)
* Complex estate planning vehicles

**What automation enables:**

* Pre-filled returns for 95% of filers
* Third-party reporting closes loopholes automatically
* No forms, schedules, or professional preparation for most Americans

---

## **Q3: Who benefits and who pays more?**

### **The short answer**

* **Working and middle-class families:** pay less  
* **Upper-middle-class families under \$400K:** protected from increases  
* **Extreme wealth:** pays more, through broader bases and higher top-end rates  
* **Everyone:** saves time and money on compliance

### **The pattern**

* Eliminating payroll taxes alone provides a major tax cut for most workers  
* Families with children benefit from automatic credits  
* Capital gains below \$1.5M are tax-free (replaces the primary residence exclusion with a universal lifetime exemption), progressive rates above that (15%/20%/27%/32%)  
* Very large incomes and very large fortunes contribute more

**In plain terms:**  
A nurse, a teacher, a small business owner, and a dual-income professional household all come out ahead. A nine-figure fortune pays more.

---

## **Q4: Is this plan fiscally responsible?**

Yes. The Fair & Simple Tax Act is **revenue-neutral today and more durable over time**.

It achieves this by:

* Broadening the tax base  
* Closing major avoidance strategies  
* Modestly strengthening top-end rates  
* Reducing the tax gap through automation and third-party reporting  
* Creating a more vibrant environment for national priorities and values through transparency and simplicity

Rather than relying on optimistic growth assumptions, the Act prioritizes **structural soundness**.

---

## **Part 2: Core Mechanics**

---

## **Q5: What happens to payroll taxes?**

Employees stop paying them. Employers continue funding the system under a renamed contribution. Self-employed workers see the largest proportional cut.

The result is:

* Bigger paychecks  
* Lower distortion between wage and non-wage income  
* Full preservation of Social Security and Medicare benefits

**Does this hide the tax or jeopardize benefits?**

No. Funding is unchanged; benefits are unchanged. The employer Safety Net Contribution (ESNC) fully funds Social Security and Medicare. General revenues backstop the transition. Benefit formulas do not change.

Pay stubs still show the ESNC so workers see the contribution made on their behalf. The tax simply sits where the economic incidence already falls — nothing is hidden.

One employer-side charge removes duplicative calculations for Schedule C, gig, and capital gains filers, improving compliance and predictability.

If visibility is desired, policymakers can retain a small employee line (e.g., 1–2%) while keeping the rest employer-side. The base design maximizes simplicity and preserves funding.

---

## **Q6: How do the new income tax brackets work?**

The system uses **five clear brackets**, indexed annually for inflation.

There are:

* no phase-outs  
* no hidden cliffs  
* no alternative minimum taxes

Everyone knows their marginal rate. Everyone pays something. And families under \$400,000 are protected from increases.

---

## **Q7: How are capital gains, dividends, and investment income taxed?**

### **Capital Gains (Asset Appreciation)**

| Cumulative Lifetime Gains |  Marginal Capital Gains Rate |
| ----- | ----- |
| \$0 – \$1.5M | **0%** |
| \$1.5M – \$3M | **15%** |
| \$3M – \$10M | **20%** |
| \$10M – \$50M | **27%** |
| \$50M+ | **32%** |

Key rules:

* Assets must be held **more than one year** to qualify  
* Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income  
* The exemption is **\$1.5M per person** — married couples filing jointly can combine exemptions for a **\$3M combined exemption**
* In divorce, each person retains whatever portion of their individual exemption remains unused
* The exemption applies across all assets — once you've used \$1.5M in gains, you're done

This structure protects ordinary wealth-building while ensuring very large gains contribute more.

### **Dividends (Investment Yield)**

* The distinction between 'qualified' and 'ordinary' dividends is eliminated  
* **All dividends are taxed annually at investment income rates**  
* **Dividends do not qualify for the lifetime exemption**

This ensures the exemption rewards long-term growth, not recurring investment income.

### **Interest Income**

* Interest, including from municipal bonds, is taxed as ordinary income  
* Issuer-based exemptions are eliminated  
* The same rules apply to everyone

### **Foreign Investments**

* Foreign dividends are taxed under the same rules as domestic dividends  
* Taxes paid abroad receive a dollar-for-dollar credit, capped at U.S. tax owed

## **Q8: What is the American Savings Account (ASA)?**

The ASA replaces more than 15 fragmented account types with one simple, universal account that behaves similarly to a ROTH IRA.

### **How it works**

* \$1,000 government seed at birth  
* Up to \$30,000 in annual contributions (after-tax, indexed — meaning it rises annually with inflation to preserve purchasing power)
* Tax-free growth

### **Withdrawals**

* **Contributions:** Withdraw anytime, tax-free, penalty-free  
* **Gains before age 60:** Taxed as capital gains, uses lifetime \$1.5M exemption  
* **Gains after age 60:** Up to \$2.5M in total withdrawals (indexed) are tax-free; gains above \$2.5M are taxed as capital gains

**Example:** You contribute \$2M over your lifetime. It grows to \$8M by age 65. You can withdraw \$2.5M tax-free after age 60. The remaining \$5.5M in gains are taxed as capital gains when withdrawn (using any remaining lifetime exemption, then at 15%/20%/27%/32% rates).

If you've used your full \$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption elsewhere before age 60, early withdrawal of gains is taxed at the applicable capital gains rate (15%/20%/27%/32% depending on your total lifetime gains).

### **What it replaces**

401(k)s, Traditional and Roth IRAs, SEPs, SIMPLE plans, 529 plans, Coverdell accounts, ABLE accounts, and similar programs.

### **Why one account?**

Complex savings systems disproportionately benefit higher-income households with advisors. One universal account increases participation, reduces administrative costs, and makes public subsidies for saving transparent and fair.

Even early withdrawals benefit from years of tax-free compounding. Leaving gains until age 60 provides maximum benefit.

## **Q9: What happens to my existing 401(k), IRA, or other legacy accounts?**

You can keep them or convert them — and conversion is designed to be financially attractive for most people.

### **The Conversion Offer**

* Convert pre-tax retirement accounts (Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA, SEP, SIMPLE) into the ASA at a **one-time 10% tax rate**
* The 10% applies only to **pre-tax contributions and gains** — after-tax contributions (like Roth accounts) convert with no additional tax
* Pay the tax in the year you convert
* Convert all at once or gradually over multiple years — your choice
* Once converted, balances grow and withdraw tax-free under ASA rules

### **Why this is attractive**

For most savers, this is a significantly better deal than waiting:

* **Lower rate:** 10% is far below the 22-35% marginal rates most retirement savers face today
* **Tax-free forever:** After conversion, all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free (up to \$2.5M after age 60)
* **Simplicity:** One account, clear rules, no Required Minimum Distributions
* **Flexibility:** Convert as much or as little as you want each year to manage your tax bill

**Example:** You have \$500,000 in a Traditional 401(k). You could convert it all at once (pay \$50,000 in taxes that year), or convert \$100,000 per year over five years (\$10,000 in taxes each year). Either way, once converted, that money grows to \$1.5M by retirement — all tax-free. Under the old system, you'd pay 22-35% on every withdrawal.

### **How it works**

* Financial institutions like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard would provide **simple conversion tools** — just like partial Roth conversions today
* Select "convert all" or "convert \$X amount" 
* Tax is calculated automatically and due that year
* No ongoing tracking, no payment plans, no complexity
* Those who don't convert can keep existing accounts under current rules, but no new contributions are allowed

The goal is simplification without forcing disruption — and giving millions of Americans a clear financial benefit for participating.

## **Q10: What is the Child Tax Credit under this plan, and how is it different from today?**

The Act replaces three overlapping programs with one simple, universal benefit.

### **Today's System: Complex, Hidden, Unequal**

The current system spreads child support across three separate programs, creating confusion and leaving money on the table:

**Child Tax Credit (CTC):**
* Up to \$2,000 per child
* Phases out starting at \$200,000 (single) or \$400,000 (married)
* Only \$1,700 is refundable (meaning lower-income families get less)
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$200B

**Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):**
* Varies wildly: \$600 for no kids, up to \$7,430 for three+ children
* Rewards work but penalizes earning above thresholds
* Requires earned income (excludes caregivers, retirees, disabled)
* 15%+ error rate due to complexity
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$70B

**Child and Dependent Care Credit:**
* 20-35% of childcare costs (max \$2,100 for two+ children)
* Only helps those who itemize
* Requires receipts and provider tax IDs
* Estimated annual cost: ~\$6B

**Total current system: ~\$276B annually**

**The Problem:** This Byzantine structure creates perverse incentives. Families face "benefits cliffs" where earning \$100 more means losing \$500 in benefits. Filing is complicated. Support is unpredictable.

### **The Fair & Simple System: Universal \$2,500 per Child**

* **\$2,500 per child per year**
* **Universal** — everyone with children gets it
* **Fully refundable** — the full amount, no phase-outs
* **No filing required** — automatically delivered via payroll or direct payment

**New system cost: ~\$185B annually (74M children × \$2,500)**

**Net savings from consolidation: ~\$91B per year**

### **The Complete Picture: How Families Come Out Ahead**

Here's where it gets important: the child benefit alone looks modest compared to what some families receive today. But combine it with **payroll tax elimination**, and every family gets significantly ahead:

#### **Example 1: Single Parent, 2 Children, \$28,000 Annual Income**
| Component | Today | Fair & Simple | Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gross Income | \$28,000 | \$28,000 | — |
| Payroll Tax (7.65% FICA) | -\$2,142 | \$0 | **+\$2,142** ✓ |
| Income Tax | -\$200 | \$0 | **+\$200** ✓ |
| EITC (refundable) | +\$3,540 | — | — |
| CTC (refundable) | +\$0 | — | — |
| **Child Benefit (\$2,500 × 2)** | — | **+\$5,000** | **+\$5,000** ✓ |
| **Total Change in Taxes + Benefits** | — | — | **+\$3,542 (+12.7%)** |

#### **Example 2: Married Couple, 1 Child, \$75,000 Annual Income**
| Component | Today | Fair & Simple | Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gross Income | \$75,000 | \$75,000 | — |
| Payroll Tax (7.65% FICA) | -\$5,738 | \$0 | **+\$5,738** ✓ |
| Income Tax | -\$5,850 | -\$2,100 | **+\$3,750** ✓ |
| EITC | +\$0 | — | — |
| CTC | +\$2,000 | — | — |
| **Child Benefit (\$2,500 × 1)** | — | **+\$2,500** | **+\$2,500** ✓ |
| **Total Change in Taxes + Benefits** | — | — | **+\$7,988 (+10.7%)** |

#### **Example 3: Married Couple, 2 Children, \$150,000 Annual Income**
| Component | Today | Fair & Simple | Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gross Income | \$150,000 | \$150,000 | — |
| Payroll Tax (7.65% FICA) | -\$11,475 | \$0 | **+\$11,475** ✓ |
| Income Tax | -\$18,900 | -\$13,450 | **+\$5,450** ✓ |
| EITC | +\$0 | — | — |
| CTC | +\$4,000 | — | — |
| **Child Benefit (\$2,500 × 2)** | — | **+\$5,000** | **+\$5,000** ✓ |
| **Total Change in Taxes + Benefits** | — | — | **+\$10,975 (+7.3%)** |

### **Why This Works**

The Fair & Simple system accomplishes what current patchwork programs cannot:

1. **Predictability** — families know exactly what they'll receive
2. **Universality** — the same benefit for everyone with children
3. **Alignment with work** — payroll tax elimination means no "benefits cliffs"
4. **Administrative efficiency** — \$91B saved by consolidating three programs into one

**The political genius:** This appeals across the aisle. Conservatives like that we're simplifying government, reducing hidden taxes, and cutting fraud. Progressives like that every family with children gets automatic support with no conditions attached.

# Part 3: Closing Loopholes

### **The Core Problem: Complexity Enables Avoidance**

The current tax code is so complex that it has become a system optimized for **non-compliance by design**. When rules are incomprehensible, enforcement becomes impossible. When special rules proliferate, wealthy taxpayers hire specialists to exploit them. And when ordinary Americans can't understand the rules, they lose faith in the system itself.

The result is massive fiscal leakage:

The "tax gap" — the difference between taxes owed and taxes collected — **exceeds \$600 billion annually** according to the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate. [^1] That's not a rounding error. That's half the annual defense budget. That's the entire budget of the Department of Education.

But the tax gap is only part of the story. Beyond non-compliance, there are entire **legal strategies** built into the tax code that allow extreme wealth to avoid taxation indefinitely:

* **Stepped-up basis at death** allows \~\$300 billion in gains to escape taxation every year
* **Buy-borrow-die strategies** let billionaires live off asset-backed loans while never selling appreciated assets, paying zero tax on the economic gain
* **QSBS and carried interest** carve-outs create preferential treatment for specific industries
* **Foundations and dynasty trusts** allow wealth to compound across generations tax-free

These aren't accidents or oversights. They're embedded features of a code so complex that most Americans — and many policymakers — don't even know they exist.

### **Why This Matters**

When the wealthy can permanently avoid taxation while working families pay their full share, it does three things:

1. **Undermines fiscal sustainability** — deficits grow because revenue declines relative to GDP
2. **Corrodes public confidence** — people stop believing the system is fair
3. **Concentrates wealth and power** — dynasties of capital compound without limit or taxation

The Fair & Simple Tax Act addresses this by replacing complex carve-outs with simple, consistent rules that apply equally to everyone.

## **Q10: How does the Act close the 'buy, borrow, die' loophole?**

### **What is 'Buy, Borrow, Die'?**

This is a tax avoidance strategy available exclusively to ultra-wealthy individuals who own highly appreciated assets. Here's how it works today:

**Step 1: Buy an appreciating asset**
You purchase Apple stock for \$100 million when the company is young and undiscovered.

**Step 2: Borrow against it**
Twenty years later, Apple stock is worth \$5 billion. Instead of selling the stock (which would trigger a capital gains tax on your \$4.9 billion profit), you borrow \$500 million using the stock as collateral. You pay interest on the loan, but you've accessed wealth tax-free.

**Step 3: Live off the borrowed money**
You use the \$500 million loan to fund a lavish lifestyle — yachts, jets, real estate, anything. The loan is not income, so you pay no tax on it. You can borrow repeatedly as the asset appreciates, accessing unlimited wealth.

**Step 4: Die with a stepped-up basis**
When you die, the heir inherits the \$5 billion in Apple stock with a 'stepped-up basis' — the IRS resets the cost basis to its value at death. The \$4.9 billion in gains simply **disappear from the tax system**. The heir can immediately sell the stock and owe zero capital gains tax.

**Net result:** You and your heirs extracted \$500 million in economic benefit, funded a lifestyle for decades, and paid zero in capital gains taxes on \$4.9 billion in appreciation. The \$500 million in loans are repaid from the inherited assets after stepping up the basis, often leaving the estate larger than it started.

### **How common is this?**

This strategy is used exclusively by ultra-high-net-worth individuals. It requires:

* Assets worth tens of millions or more
* Ability to borrow substantial amounts against them  
* Estate planning sophistication  
* Access to specialized financial advisors  

It's not a strategy available to the merely wealthy — you need dynastic levels of wealth to make it work. But for those who can use it, it's devastatingly effective.

**Estimates:** Between 10,000 and 50,000 ultra-wealthy households may use buy-borrow-die strategies at any given time, though the practice is heavily concentrated among the top 0.01% of wealth holders. Goldman Sachs estimated in 2021 that the annual federal tax revenue loss from this single strategy exceeds \$50 billion.[^2]

### **Why does it work today?**

Two rules work together to enable this loophole:

1. **Loans are not taxable income** — borrowing money is not treated as income, so there's no tax when you take out a loan (and interest payments are often tax-deductible as well)
2. **Stepped-up basis at death** — when you die, your heirs inherit assets with a basis reset to death-day value, erasing all prior gains from the tax system

Together, these two rules create a bizarre outcome: a billionaire can live entirely off borrowed money for decades (no income tax), access unlimited untaxed wealth (no capital gains tax), and pass that wealth to heirs without ever triggering a tax on the appreciation (no tax at death).

### **How does the Fair & Simple Tax Act fix it?**

The Act closes this loophole by treating asset-backed borrowing differently:

**New Rule: Borrowing Against Appreciated Assets Triggers Tax**

* When you borrow against an appreciated asset (one worth more than you paid for it), the excess value of the loan triggers a deemed sale and taxable gain  
* The tax is calculated on the appreciation only (not the entire asset value)  
* The tax is deferred until the loan is repaid or the asset is sold

**Applied to our Apple example:**

* You own Apple stock with a cost basis of \$100M, currently worth \$5B  
* You borrow \$500M against the stock  
* The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats this as a partial deemed sale  
* You recognize \$400M in capital gains (the amount your stock appreciated above what you borrowed: \$500M loan minus \$100M cost basis)  
* You owe capital gains tax on \$400M in gains using the lifetime exemption and progressive rates (if you've already used your \$1.5M exemption, this is taxed at 15%, 20%, 27%, or 32% depending on your total lifetime gains)  
* Your basis steps up to \$500M (the amount borrowed), so your remaining unrealized gains are only \$4.5B (\$5B current value minus \$500M new basis) — preventing double taxation if you later sell or pass the asset to heirs
* You can still borrow the money, but the tax is owed in the year of borrowing (or can be deferred if the asset is illiquid, with interest accruing)

**Why this works:**

This aligns taxation with economic reality. A billionaire borrowing \$500M against appreciated stock has received an economic benefit — they've accessed and consumed wealth. The fact that they technically haven't 'sold' the asset is a mere formality. The Fair & Simple Tax Act says: if you've extracted economic value through borrowing, you owe tax on the gain you've realized, just as if you had sold and repurchased the asset.

**Stepped-up basis is eliminated:**

The current stepped-up basis rule was created decades ago as an administrative convenience — tracking the original cost basis of assets across decades of ownership was thought to be too burdensome and expensive. So policymakers simply reset the basis at death, making accounting easier.

But this "simplification" became a massive loophole. Today, when billionaires die with \$100+ billion in unrealized gains, those gains simply vanish from the tax system. The wealthy learned to exploit this administrative rule, turning it into a permanent wealth transfer device.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act eliminates this loophole by treating death as a realization event, just like selling an asset. When you die, unrealized gains are taxed on your final return using the same lifetime capital gains system. Your heirs inherit a 'clean basis' — the value at death becomes their cost basis. This closes the final loophole: they can't inherit \$5B in stock and immediately sell it tax-free.

### **What about legitimate lending?**

A common question: 'What if I borrow against my home or farm to invest?' or 'What if I take out a regular business loan?'

**The answer:** Regular loans for business or personal use are not affected. The rule applies only to **asset-backed loans where the collateral itself has appreciated above your cost basis and the loan amount exceeds your basis.**

Examples of what is NOT affected:

* A business takes out a \$10M bank loan to expand — no special tax  
* A farmer borrows \$5M against farmland to buy equipment — no special tax  
* A homeowner takes out a mortgage to buy a house — no special tax  
* A young entrepreneur borrows against a growing tech company to fund operations — no special tax (the company likely hasn't appreciated much yet)

The rule targets only situations where:
1. An asset has appreciated dramatically (like \$100M Apple stock → \$5B)
2. You're borrowing an amount that implies you're extracting value from gains, not from legitimate business needs
3. The goal is unlocking wealth without triggering tax

This distinction is administratively clear: lenders already distinguish between collateral value and borrower's basis. Financial institutions would report the necessary information automatically.

### **Impact**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act means:

* Billionaires can't live tax-free off borrowed money indefinitely  
* Wealth must eventually be taxed or passed to heirs who inherit with a clean basis (and then owe tax if they sell)  
* The step-up in basis loophole is closed  
* Families and small businesses are unaffected

**Bottom line:** Buy-borrow-die was a strategy that turned the tax system upside down, letting ultra-wealthy individuals treat borrowing as a substitute for selling, and stepping up basis as a substitute for paying what was owed. The Fair & Simple Tax Act treats borrowing as an economic event and treats death as a realization event — aligning the tax system with basic fairness.

## **Q11: What happens when someone dies?**

Unrealized gains are taxed on the final return, using the same lifetime brackets. Heirs inherit assets with a clean basis.

Most families owe nothing. Very large estates pay what has long been deferred.

# 

# Part 4: Common Concerns

## **Q12: Won’t this hurt families in high-tax states?**

**No.** The Fair & Simple Tax Act recognizes state and local tax burdens in a way that is fair, simple, and broadly shared — without preserving a loophole that primarily benefited the wealthiest households. The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces a broken deduction with a fair, automatic credit — and most middle-class families come out ahead. 

Under current law, the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction is poorly designed:

* Only about **10% of filers benefit**, mostly high earners who itemize  
* The value of the deduction rises with your tax bracket, meaning it is worth far more to a household earning \$500,000 than one earning \$80,000  
* It adds paperwork, complexity, and planning games without meaningfully helping most families

As a result, the old SALT deduction functioned less as broad-based relief and more as a narrow, upside-skewed subsidy.

### **Why recognize state and local taxes at all?**

Americans already pay state and local taxes to fund core public services like schools, infrastructure, and public safety. A fair federal tax system should recognize that burden — **without creating an open-ended loophole that primarily benefits high earners**.

The Fair & Simple Tax Act does this by replacing the old SALT deduction with a simple, automatic credit that applies to everyone.

### **How the new system works**

Instead of a deduction that only helps itemizers, the Act provides an **automatic SALT credit**:

* Available to **all filers**, not just those who itemize  
* Calculated automatically using a blended measure of state and local tax burden  
* **Capped**, so benefits do not grow without limit for very high earners  
* Delivered with no additional paperwork

### **The bigger picture**

For most families — especially those earning under \$400,000 — the combination of:

* Payroll tax elimination (a 7.65% raise)  
* Lower or similar income tax rates  
* Automatic child benefits

far outweighs any change in SALT treatment.

## **Q13: Doesn’t eliminating the primary residence exclusion hurt homeowners?**

**No. The lifetime capital gains exemption protects most home sales — and treats homeowners more fairly over time.**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, each individual receives a **\$1.5 million lifetime capital gains exemption** that applies to *all* long-term gains — including gains from the sale of a primary residence.

For most homeowners, this means their home sale remains completely tax-free.

### **A typical homeowner scenario**

* Bought a home for \$250,000  
* Sold years later for \$650,000  
* Total gain: \$400,000  
* Lifetime exemption used: \$400,000  
* **Tax owed: \$0**

The homeowner still has \$1.1 million of exemption remaining for future gains from investments, additional home sales, or a small business exit.

### **What if I move more than once?**

The lifetime exemption is designed to cover **multiple life events**, not just a single sale. Most households accumulate far less than \$1.5 million in total lifetime housing gains, even after several moves over decades.

This means families can buy a starter home, move for work, upsize as their family grows, and downsize later in life — all without triggering capital gains tax in most cases.

### **Why replace the current exclusion?**

The existing home sale exclusion:

* applies only to homeowners, not renters who build wealth through saving  
* encourages tax-driven housing decisions  
* requires tracking ownership and use tests

By contrast, the lifetime exemption:

* applies equally to homes, stocks, and businesses  
* rewards long-term saving regardless of asset type  
* eliminates special rules and paperwork

### **The broader principle**

Unlike the current system, which privileges housing over other forms of saving, the Fair & Simple Tax Act treats homeownership as **one important way** families build long-term security — not a tax-preferred category that distorts behavior.

**Bottom line:**  
Most home sales remain tax-free. Families who move over time are protected. And the tax code treats homeowners and renters more fairly than it does today.

## **Q14: How does this affect charitable giving and nonprofits?**

**The Fair & Simple Tax Act encourages charitable giving for everyone — not just those who itemize.**

Under the current tax code, the charitable deduction is available primarily to high-income households who itemize. For most Americans, giving to charity provides little or no tax benefit at all.

The Act replaces this system with a **simple, universal charitable credit**.

### **How the new charitable credit works**

* Donations to qualified charitable organizations receive a **15% refundable tax credit**  
* The credit is available to **all filers**, regardless of income or whether they itemize  
* The credit is **capped at 25% of a filer’s total tax liability**  
* Contributions must be made in cash or publicly traded securities and reported electronically by the charity

In practical terms:

* A \$1,000 donation generates a \$150 reduction in taxes owed  
* That benefit is the same whether you earn \$50,000 or \$5 million

  ### **Why replace the deduction with a credit?**

The current deduction system has several flaws:

* It provides **larger subsidies to wealthier donors** (because deductions are worth more in higher tax brackets)  
* Roughly **90% of filers receive no tax benefit** for charitable giving  
* It adds complexity and planning strategies that favor sophisticated taxpayers

By contrast, a flat credit:

* treats every donor equally  
* makes the incentive clear and predictable  
* encourages broader participation in charitable giving

  ### **What about large gifts and philanthropy?**

The Act continues to encourage significant charitable contributions, but with reasonable limits.

Capping the credit at a share of tax liability ensures that charitable giving remains a voluntary act of generosity — not a way to redirect the majority of one’s tax bill toward personally favored causes.

This preserves public funding for shared priorities while still strongly supporting nonprofit organizations.

### **What this means for nonprofits**

* Middle- and lower-income donors are more likely to receive a meaningful incentive to give  
* The donor base broadens beyond a small number of high-income households  
* Giving decisions become less driven by tax planning and more by mission and impact

**Bottom line:**  
The Fair & Simple Tax Act replaces an uneven, opaque deduction with a clear, universal incentive that supports charities, respects democratic budgeting, and encourages giving across the income spectrum.

## **Q15: Will this punish entrepreneurs and innovators?**

**No. The Fair & Simple Tax Act is designed to reward long-term innovation, protect the startup ecosystem, and eliminate loopholes that distort incentives.**

America’s greatest economic advantage is its ability to turn risky ideas into world-changing companies. This Act is built around that reality — and around the fact that innovation thrives in systems that are predictable, neutral, and fair.

### **Why this strengthens, rather than weakens, innovation**

**1\. The United States remains the best place in the world to build a company.**  
The Act preserves low taxes on long-term investment, a generous lifetime capital gains exemption, and clear, predictable rules. For the vast majority of founders, effective tax rates on exits are **lower than or comparable to current law**, without relying on fragile carve-outs.

The goal is not to penalize success — it is to remove uncertainty so founders can focus on building, not tax planning.

**2\. Patient, high-risk capital is still favored.**  
Founders and early investors who hold equity for the long term continue to benefit from capital gains treatment and the lifetime exemption. Short-term trading is taxed as income; long-term company building is rewarded.

This reinforces the same time horizons that venture capital already depends on.

**3\. The QSBS loophole is replaced with something better, not nothing.**  
QSBS helped some founders, but it was narrow, complex, and arbitrarily structured. Many legitimate startups and investors never qualified.

The Act replaces QSBS with a **simple, universal rule** that applies to all companies and all founders, regardless of industry, structure, or legal form.

That is a win for innovation, not a loss.

**4\. Extreme outcomes are treated differently — deliberately.**  
The Act asks more only when lifetime gains reach levels that are extraordinarily rare and highly concentrated. These adjustments are modest, predictable, and well below top labor income rates.

This reflects a basic principle: America should reward extraordinary success, but not build a tax code that depends on it being completely untaxed.

**5\. Innovation depends on systems, not carve-outs.**  
Breakthroughs happen in ecosystems — universities, infrastructure, talent pipelines, and deep capital markets. A simpler, more durable tax system strengthens those foundations, which matter more to long-term innovation than any single exemption.

**Bottom line:**  
The Fair & Simple Tax Act protects ambition, rewards risk-taking, and preserves America’s innovation edge — while ensuring that the system works for decades rather than depending on fragile loopholes.

## **Appendix A: Revenue Model**

### **Executive Summary**

The Fair & Simple Tax Act is **revenue-neutral in Years 1-5** thanks to the Great Conversion windfall. Beyond Year 5, the simplified system generates automatic benefits — government efficiency, GDP growth from reduced deadweight loss, and improved compliance. If additional revenue is needed, we've built a foundation that makes future adjustments straightforward.

### **Years 1-20: The Transition Trust Fund Bridge**

The Great Conversion offers holders of pre-tax retirement accounts (Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA, SEP, SIMPLE) a one-time deal: convert to ASA at a 10% tax rate, payable over 10 years.

**The Lockbox Mechanism:** While the tax payments from the Great Conversion are collected over 10 years, the **Transition Trust Fund** releases them into the budget over **20 years**.

* **Total Collections:** \~\$1.0 Trillion (collected Years 1–10)  
* **Trust Fund Payout:** \$50 Billion/year (guaranteed Years 1–20)

**Why this matters:** This lowers the "annual revenue" appearing in the budget during the early years (preventing Congress from spending a temporary surplus) and fills the gap in Years 11–20, acting as a bridge until the structural benefits of GDP growth and efficiency fully mature.

**Years 1-5 Net Position (Budgeted):**

| Scenario | Annual Costs | Annual Gains | Trust Fund Payout | Net |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Conservative | \-\$1,000B | \+\$785B | \+\$50B | **\-\$165B** |
| Mid | \-\$1,000B | \+\$910B | \+\$50B | **\-\$40B** |
| Optimistic | \-\$1,000B | \+\$1,040B | \+\$50B | **\+\$90B** |

**Conclusion:** With the Transition Trust Fund smoothing the curve, the plan remains roughly revenue-neutral, without creating a fiscal cliff later.

### **Years 6+: Automatic Benefits**

Three structural changes generate ongoing revenue/savings without legislative action:

#### **1\. Government Efficiency (+\$20-50B/year)**

| Savings Source | Estimate | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| IRS workforce optimization | \$5-10B | 95% file-free \= fewer processors needed |
| Reduced audits | \$3-5B | Simpler code \= less to audit |
| Reduced tax court/litigation | \$1-2B | Fewer disputes, clearer rules |
| Reduced compliance assistance | \$2-3B | Fewer help calls, simpler forms |
| Fraud reduction | \$5-15B | Third-party reporting, automated matching |
| **Total Government Savings** | **\$16-35B** |  |

Export to Sheets

#### **2\. GDP Growth from Reduced Deadweight Loss (+\$50-150B/year by Year 10\)**

The current tax system imposes massive economic drag:

| Drag Source | Annual Cost | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Compliance time | \$213B | 7.1 billion hours × \$30/hr average |
| Professional tax services | \$30B | H\&R Block, CPAs, tax attorneys |
| Behavioral distortions | \$100-200B | Decisions made for tax reasons, not economic ones |
| Capital misallocation | \$50-100B | Money in tax shelters vs. productive investment |
| Entrepreneurship suppression | Unquantified | Complexity discourages small business formation |
| **Total Deadweight Loss** | **\$400-550B** | \~2% of GDP |

Export to Sheets

**If we reclaim 25-50% of this deadweight loss:**

* Economic activity increases by \$100-275B  
* At \~20% effective federal tax rate \= **\$20-55B** direct revenue  
* Plus multiplier effects: higher wages → more income tax, more spending → more economic activity  
* **Conservative estimate:** 0.5-1% GDP boost over 10 years \= **\$50-100B/year** additional federal revenue by Year 10

#### **3\. Shrinking Tax Gap (+\$50-100B/year)**

The current "tax gap" (taxes owed but not collected) exceeds **\$600B annually**. Our reforms directly address the causes:

| Reform | Tax Gap Impact |
| :---- | :---- |
| Automated filing | Eliminates errors, catches underreporting |
| Third-party reporting | Brokerages report lifetime gains, employers report wages |
| Simpler rules | Fewer "gray areas" to exploit |
| Fewer deductions | Less opportunity for fraud |

Export to Sheets

**Conservative estimate:** Capture an additional 10-15% of the tax gap \= **\$60-90B/year**

---

### **Years 6+ Summary**

| Automatic Benefit | Annual Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Government efficiency | \+\$20-50B |
| GDP growth (deadweight loss) | \+\$50-150B |
| Reduced tax gap | \+\$50-100B |
| **Total Automatic Benefits** | **\+\$120-300B** |

Export to Sheets

Even in the conservative scenario, the combination of the Transition Trust Fund payout (+\$50B/year until Year 20\) plus automatic benefits puts us solidly in positive territory.

### **If Additional Revenue Is Needed: Menu of Options**

Should Congress determine additional revenue is necessary, the simplified tax base makes implementation straightforward:

| Option | Annual Revenue | Implementation Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Carbon Tax** (\$50/ton) | \+\$100-150B | Environmental benefits, border-adjustable |
| **Financial Transaction Tax** (0.1%) | \+\$50-100B | Targets high-frequency trading, Wall Street pays |
| **Value-Added Tax** (10%) | \+\$800B-1T | OECD standard; requires rebate for regressivity |
| **Higher ESNC** (8% → 9%) | \+\$130B | Employer-side, invisible to workers |
| **Corporate Rate** (25% → 28%) | \+\$60B | Still below pre-TCJA 35% rate |
| **Estate Exemption** (\$5M → \$3M) | \+\$20-30B | Affects \~50K estates vs. \~30K |

Export to Sheets

**Note:** These options are NOT included in the base bill. They represent a menu for future Congresses if structural deficits persist. The Fair & Simple Tax Act creates the foundation; future legislators can build on it.

### **Revenue Model Summary**

| Period | Status | Confidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Years 1-20** | Revenue-neutral (Trust Fund \+ Growth) | High |
| **Years 20+** | Sustainable (options available if needed) | Medium |

Export to Sheets

**Bottom line:** This plan doesn't rely on heroic assumptions or gimmicks. It's paid for in the short term, generates structural benefits in the medium term, and provides clear options for the long term. That's fiscal responsibility.

### **Part C: Inheritance**

#### **17\. Trust Fund Heir — Inherits \$20M**

**Decedent's situation:**

* Total estate: \$20M  
* Cost basis: \$5M  
* Unrealized gain: \$15M  
* Lifetime cap gains exemption: Never used (\$1.5M remaining)

**Step 1: Capital Gains at Death**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Unrealized Gain | \$15,000,000 |
| Lifetime Exemption Remaining | \-\$1,500,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$13,500,000 |
| Tax: 15% on \$1.5M | \$225,000 |
| Tax: 20% on \$7M | \$1,400,000 |
| Tax: 25% on \$3.5M | \$875,000 |

| Taxable Estate | \$12,500,000 |
| Estate Tax (40%) | **\$5,000,000** |

Export to Sheets

**Total Taxes at Death:** \$2,500,000 \+ \$5,000,000 \= **\$7,500,000**

**Heir Receives:** \$20,000,000 \- \$7,500,000 \= **\$12,500,000**

**Effective Tax Rate on Estate:** 37.5%

**Comparison to Current Law:**

* Current: Step-up eliminates cap gains, \$14M exemption covers estate \= **\$0 tax**  
* Fair & Simple: **\$7.5M tax**

**The heir's take:** "I'm still inheriting \$12.5 million dollars. My parents paid taxes on their gains like everyone else. That's fair."

**The Pattern:**

* Workers under \$150K: Win (FICA elimination)  
* Self-employed: Roughly neutral (SE tax cut offsets higher brackets)  
* Families with kids: Win (FICA \+ expanded CTC)  
* High earners (\$500K+): Pay more (higher brackets)  
* Capital gains under \$1.5M: Tax-free (lifetime exemption)  
* Large exits: About the same (no QSBS, but simpler)  
* Inheritance: Pay much more (step-up eliminated)

## **Appendix C: Borrowing Rule Case Studies**

The Borrowing Rule prevents the "Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy by treating loans against appreciated assets (above cost basis) as taxable events. Here's how it works in practice.

---

### **Case 1: The Cape Cod Doctor**

**Dr. Sarah Chen, 58, Primary Care Physician**

**Situation:**

* Owns vacation home in Cape Cod, bought 20 years ago for \$200,000  
* Current value: \$1,200,000  
* Unrealized gain: \$1,000,000  
* Wants to borrow \$400,000 for daughter's medical school tuition

**Under Current Law:**

* Takes home equity loan for \$400,000  
* No tax triggered  
* Plans to hold until death, when step-up eliminates gain  
* Daughter graduates, loan gets paid off over time  
* Total tax on \$1M appreciation: **\$0**

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$200,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$400,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$200,000 |
| Capital Gains Tax (15% rate\*) | **\$30,000** |
| New Basis | \$400,000 |

Export to Sheets

*Assumes she has used none of her \$1.5M lifetime exemption. If fully unused, this \$200K gain would be tax-free.*

**If she's already used her lifetime exemption:**

* \$200,000 × 15% \= \$30,000 tax  
* She still gets the \$400,000 loan  
* Her basis is now \$400,000  
* Remaining unrealized gain: \$800,000

**Dr. Chen's take:** "I paid \$30,000 in taxes to access \$400,000. That's a 7.5% 'cost' — less than the interest rate on most loans. And I won't owe tax on that \$200K again when I sell."

### **Case 2: The Tech IPO Founder**

**Marcus Williams, 42, Software Startup Founder**

**Situation:**

* Founded company 10 years ago, owns 5% post-IPO  
* Shares worth \$50,000,000  
* Cost basis: \$50,000 (original investment)  
* Unrealized gain: \$49,950,000  
* Wants to buy a \$10M house without selling shares (to avoid signaling, maintain control)

**Under Current Law:**

* Pledges \$15M in stock as collateral  
* Borrows \$10M from private bank at 5%  
* No tax triggered  
* Pays interest-only, rolls loan indefinitely  
* At death, step-up eliminates \$50M gain  
* Total tax: **\$0** (plus \~\$500K/year in interest)

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$50,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$10,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$9,950,000 |
| Lifetime Exemption | \-\$1,500,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$8,450,000 |
| Tax Calculation |  |
| — 15% on \$1.5M (\$1.5M-\$3M) | \$225,000 |
| — 20% on \$5.45M (\$3M-\$8.45M) | \$1,090,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$1,315,000** |
| New Basis | \$10,000,000 |

Export to Sheets

**Marcus's situation after borrowing:**

* Paid: \$1,315,000 in capital gains tax  
* Received: \$10,000,000 loan  
* Net proceeds: \$8,685,000  
* New basis: \$10,000,000  
* Remaining shares: \$40M in value, \$40M in unrealized gain  
* Lifetime exemption: Fully used

**Marcus's take:** "I paid \$1.3M to access \$10M. Under the old system I'd have paid \$0, but I also would have had to keep rolling debt forever. Now I own the house free and clear, my basis is reset, and I know exactly where I stand."

### **Case 3: The Inherited Wealth Heir**

**Elizabeth "Bitsy" Thornton IV, 35, Trust Beneficiary**

**Situation:**

* Inherited \$30M in diversified stocks from grandmother  
* Grandmother's basis: \$3M (90% unrealized gain)  
* Under current law, Bitsy received step-up to \$30M basis  
* Under Fair & Simple, estate paid cap gains tax; Bitsy inherited with \$30M basis  
* Bitsy wants to borrow \$5M to buy apartment in Manhattan

**Under Current Law (with step-up):**

* Basis: \$30M (stepped up at death)  
* Borrows \$5M against portfolio  
* No tax (loan is under basis)  
* Total tax: **\$0**

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

* Grandmother's estate paid \~\$6.5M in capital gains tax at death  
* Bitsy inherited with \$30M basis (clean)  
* Borrows \$5M against portfolio  
* Loan (\$5M) \< Basis (\$30M)  
* **No additional tax triggered**

**Bitsy's take:** "My grandmother's estate paid taxes that had been deferred for 40 years. I inherited less, but with a clean basis. Now I can borrow, sell, or hold without worrying about a hidden tax bill."

### **Case 4: The Serial Entrepreneur**

**Raj Patel, 55, Third-Time Founder**

**Situation:**

* Sold first company: \$2M gain (used \$1.5M exemption, paid 15% on \$500K \= \$75K)  
* Sold second company: \$5M gain (paid 15% on \$1.5M \+ 20% on \$3.5M \= \$925K)  
* Current company worth \$20M (basis \$100K)  
* Wants to borrow \$3M for new venture without selling

**Lifetime Exemption Status:** Fully used

**Borrowing Analysis:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$100,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$3,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$2,900,000 |
| Tax: 15% on \$1.5M | \$225,000 |
| Tax: 20% on \$1.4M | \$280,000 |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | **\$505,000** |
| New Basis | \$3,000,000 |

Export to Sheets

**Raj's take:** "I've had a good run. I've used my exemption, I've paid taxes along the way. \$500K on a \$3M loan is about 17% — not cheap, but I'm accessing \$20M in value without selling control. And my basis keeps going up."

### **Case 5: The Real Estate Investor**

**Linda Morrison, 62, Commercial Real Estate**

**Situation:**

* Owns strip mall bought 25 years ago for \$500,000  
* Current value: \$4,000,000  
* Unrealized gain: \$3,500,000  
* Has used \$500K of lifetime exemption on previous sales  
* Remaining exemption: \$1,000,000  
* Wants to borrow \$2M for new property acquisition

**Under Current Law:**

* 1031 exchange into new property (defer all gains)  
* Or borrow \$2M against strip mall, no tax  
* Continue deferring indefinitely  
* Step-up at death

**Under Fair & Simple Tax Act:**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Cost Basis | \$500,000 |
| Loan Amount | \$2,000,000 |
| Borrowing Above Basis | \$1,500,000 |
| Remaining Lifetime Exemption | \-\$1,000,000 |
| Taxable Gain | \$500,000 |
| Tax (15% rate) | **\$75,000** |
| New Basis | \$2,000,000 |

Export to Sheets

**Linda's take:** "I used up my remaining exemption and paid \$75K on \$500K of gain. My basis is now \$2M. I have \$2M in unrealized gain left, but I can sell or borrow against that too — I just pay as I go."

### **Summary: How the Borrowing Rule Works**

| Scenario | Loan | Basis | Above Basis | Tax | New Basis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cape Cod Doctor | \$400K | \$200K | \$200K | \$0-30K\* | \$400K |
| Tech Founder | \$10M | \$50K | \$9.95M | \$1.3M | \$10M |
| Inherited Wealth | \$5M | \$30M | \$0 | \$0 | \$30M |
| Serial Entrepreneur | \$3M | \$100K | \$2.9M | \$505K | \$3M |
| RE Investor | \$2M | \$500K | \$1.5M | \$75K | \$2M |

Export to Sheets

\*Depends on remaining lifetime exemption

**Key Principles:**

1. **Borrow up to basis \= no tax** (that's your money)  
2. **Borrow above basis \= taxable event** (that's appreciation)  
3. **Basis increases by taxed amount** (no double taxation)  
4. **Lifetime exemption applies** (most people pay less than headline rates)  
5. **Applies to all assets** (stocks, real estate, art, private companies)

## **Appendix D: Great Conversion Details**

The Great Conversion offers a one-time opportunity to convert pre-tax retirement accounts to the new American Savings Account (ASA) at a deeply discounted 10% tax rate.

---

### **Why Convert?**

**The Math:**

| Scenario | Tax Rate |
| :---- | :---- |
| Normal withdrawal (current law) | 22-37% |
| Great Conversion | **10%** |
| Savings | **12-27 percentage points** |

Export to Sheets

A \$500,000 Traditional 401(k) converted today:

* Normal withdrawal tax: \$110,000 \- \$185,000  
* Great Conversion tax: \$50,000  
* **Savings: \$60,000 \- \$135,000**

Plus: All future growth and withdrawals are tax-free.

---

### **Eligible Accounts**

**Can Convert:**

* Traditional 401(k)  
* Traditional IRA  
* 403(b)  
* 457(b)  
* SEP-IRA  
* SIMPLE IRA

**Automatic Conversion (no action needed):**

* Roth 401(k) → ARA  
* Roth IRA → ARA  
* (Same tax treatment, just new name)

**Not Eligible:**

* HSA (remains separate)  
* Taxable brokerage accounts (not retirement accounts)

---

### **How It Works**

**Step 1: Elect to Convert**

* 3-year enrollment window after bill passage  
* Convert all or part of pre-tax balance  
* Can convert in stages (Year 1: \$200K, Year 2: \$300K, etc.)

**Step 2: Calculate Tax**

* 10% of converted balance  
* Example: Convert \$400,000 → \$40,000 tax

**Step 3: Payment Options**

* **Option A:** Pay in full (one-time)  
* **Option B:** Pay over 10 years, interest-free  
  * \$40,000 tax ÷ 10 years \= \$4,000/year  
  * Added to annual tax bill  
  * No penalties for early payoff

**Step 4: Account Becomes ASA**

* Converted funds now in ASA  
* All future growth tax-free  
* Withdrawals after age 60 tax-free  
* Subject to ASA rules (\$2.5M lifetime cap)

### **Case Studies**

#### **Case 1: The Early Retiree**

**Tom, 55, recently retired**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$800,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$80,000 |
| Payment Plan | \$8,000/year for 10 years |

Export to Sheets

**Tom's Analysis:**

* He expects to be in the 25% bracket during retirement  
* Without conversion: \$800K × 25% \= \$200,000 in taxes over time  
* With conversion: \$80,000 total  
* **Savings: \$120,000**

"I'm paying \$8,000 a year for 10 years to save \$120,000 in lifetime taxes. That's a no-brainer."

#### **Case 2: The Mid-Career Professional**

**Aisha, 40, software engineer**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$350,000 |
| Expected Balance at 65 (7% growth) | \$1,890,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$35,000 |

Export to Sheets

**Aisha's Analysis:**

* If she doesn't convert, the \$350K grows to \$1.89M  
* Taxed at withdrawal: \$1.89M × 25% \= \$472,500  
* If she converts now: \$35,000 tax, then \$1.89M withdraws tax-free  
* **Savings: \$437,500**

"The earlier you convert, the more you save. 25 years of tax-free growth is incredible."

#### **Case 3: The High Earner Approaching Retirement**

**James, 62, executive**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| Traditional 401(k) Balance | \$2,000,000 |
| Conversion Tax (10%) | \$200,000 |
| Payment Plan | \$20,000/year for 10 years |

Export to Sheets

**Complication:** ASA has a \$2.5M lifetime cap. James needs to plan carefully.

**James's Strategy:**

* Convert \$2M to ASA (at \$2.5M cap, room for some growth)  
* Pay \$200K over 10 years  
* Expected withdrawals in 35% bracket without conversion: \$700,000 in taxes  
* **Savings: \$500,000**

"Even at \$2M, the conversion saves me half a million. The cap doesn't hurt me because I'm near retirement anyway."

#### **Case 4: The Partial Converter**

**Maria, 45, small business owner**

|  | Amount |
| :---- | :---- |
| SEP-IRA Balance | \$600,000 |
| Current Income Tax Bracket | 35% |
| Expected Retirement Bracket | 25% |

Export to Sheets

**Maria's Analysis:**

* She's in a high bracket now, will be lower in retirement  
* Still, 10% \< 25%, so conversion wins  
* But she wants to hedge: converts \$300,000 now, waits on rest

**Partial Conversion:**

* Year 1: Convert \$300,000 → \$30,000 tax  
* Year 3 (end of window): Convert remaining \$350,000 → \$35,000 tax  
* **Total tax: \$65,000**

"I converted half immediately and waited to see how the transition went. Both tranches saved me money."

### **Who Should NOT Convert?**

**Consider keeping Traditional accounts if:**

1. **Very low expected retirement income** — If you'll be in the 5-15% brackets in retirement, the savings from 10% conversion are smaller  
2. **Near the ARA cap** — If converting would push you well over \$2.5M, excess growth may face penalties  
3. **Need funds before 59½** — Converting requires the 10% tax; early withdrawal from Traditional may be cheaper depending on circumstances  
4. **State tax considerations** — Some states don't tax retirement income; conversion may trigger state tax

---

### **Revenue Impact**

**Assumptions:**

* Total pre-tax retirement assets: \~\$20 trillion  
* Conversion rate: 40-60%  
* Converted assets: \$8-12 trillion

**Revenue:**

* \$8-12T × 10% \= \$800B \- \$1.2T  
* Collected over 10 years \= \$80-120B/year

**Budget Treatment:**

* Years 1-5: Significant revenue boost (front-loaded conversions)  
* Years 6-10: Declining as payment plans complete  
* Years 11+: No conversion revenue, but also no deferred tax liability

---

### **Administrative Details**

**Employer Plans:**

* Employers must offer conversion option to all participants  
* Can convert in-plan or roll to personal ASA  
* Employer match continues to new ASA

**Record Keeping:**

* IRS tracks conversion amounts and payment schedules  
* Taxpayers receive annual statement showing:  
  * Original conversion amount  
  * Remaining payments  
  * ARA balance and lifetime cap status

**Penalties:**

* Missed payments: Standard IRS collection procedures  
* Fraudulent conversion: Standard tax fraud penalties

### **Timeline**

| Year | Action |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Bill passes |
| 1-3 | Conversion window open |
| 3 | Window closes for new conversions |
| 4-13 | Payment plans continue |
| 14+ | All conversions complete |

**Bottom line:** The Great Conversion is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to move retirement savings into a simpler, tax-free structure at a fraction of normal cost. Most Americans with pre-tax retirement accounts should convert.

## **Appendix E: Account Underutilization Data**

**Retirement Accounts:**

* 54.4% of all families have retirement accounts; 45.6% have none (Federal Reserve, 2022\)  
* Racial disparity: 61.8% white families vs. 34.8% Black families vs. 27.5% Hispanic families  
* Tax incentives are poorly targeted — most subsidies go to high-income taxpayers who would save anyway

**529 Plans:**

* Less than 3% of families use 529 plans or Coverdell accounts  
* 54% of parents are unaware of 529 programs  
* 43% don't use them because they've never heard of them  
* Those who save tend to be at the higher end of income and wealth distributions

**Current complexity:** 15+ account types (401k, 403b, 457, Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Solo 401k, HSA, FSA, 529, Coverdell ESA, ABLE, UGMA, UTMA...). Each has different limits, rules, and tax treatment.

Our \$5M exemption remains among the most generous in the developed world.

### **Assessment**

**Income Tax:** Our 45% top rate aligns with UK and Australian peers while maintaining progressive structure. With state taxes, top marginal rates remain under 55% depending on state.

**Capital Gains:** Our \$1.5M lifetime exemption \+ progressive rates (15-32%) are competitive globally. Most Americans pay 0-15%. Only the ultra-wealthy approach rates charged in Nordic countries.

**Corporate:** Our 25% matches UK/France exactly. Above US current law, but middle of OECD pack.

**Estate:** Our 40% rate is standard. Our \$5M exemption is more generous than almost every peer country.

**Bottom line:** Competitive with developed economies. Not punitive, not a tax haven. A system that works.

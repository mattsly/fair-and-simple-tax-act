Below is a **final, canonical Tenets section** written for the **Meta Document**. This is the single source of truth that both PR-FAQs should link to. It is dense, neutral, and system-oriented, and it avoids sounding ideological or format-heavy.

You can drop this in essentially verbatim.

## Shared Design Tenets

This project is built around a small number of shared design tenets that apply equally to tax reform (Phase 1) and Social Security modernization (Phase 2). These tenets are not policy outcomes or rate targets. They are constraints on how the system is designed, evaluated, and adjusted over time.

### 1. Radical Simplicity

Public systems should be clearly explainable, mechanically enforceable, and ideally automatable. If a rule cannot be understood without specialists or implemented reliably in software, it does not belong. Simplicity lowers compliance costs, limits avoidance, improves transparency, and makes outcomes easier to model and debate. Complexity is treated as a cost, not a feature.

### 2. Fuel the Climb (Don’t Protect the Summit)

The system should reward work, entrepreneurship, and long-term participation in the economy, not financial engineering or the preservation of entrenched advantage. Fairness should be evaluated over a lifetime rather than through annual snapshots, reflecting modern, non-linear careers. Incentives should favor productive effort and broad-based upward mobility over rent-seeking, avoidance, or asset defense.

### 3. Fiscal Durability

The system must be fiscally responsible and durable across economic cycles and demographic change. Reforms should rely on broad bases, predictable revenue, and parameters that can be adjusted over time without reopening the system’s core structure. Durable systems reduce reliance on temporary patches, political gimmicks, or crisis-driven overhauls.

### How These Tenets Are Used

These tenets intentionally separate **structure from calibration**. They define what good system design looks like, while leaving room for reasonable disagreement about rates, thresholds, and timing. The goal is not to lock in a single set of numbers, but to create a framework that can be transparently modeled, debated, and adjusted over time.

The two PR-FAQs that follow apply these same tenets to different policy domains. They are separated to allow focused debate, but they are designed to function as parts of a single, coherent system.

### How to reference this from the PR-FAQs (recommended wording)

In each child document, include a single early sentence like:

> *This proposal is governed by a shared set of design tenets described in the project overview. Those tenets emphasize radical simplicity, lifetime fairness, and fiscal durability, and are applied throughout this document.*

If you want, next we can:

* Insert this cleanly into the Meta Document with surrounding context, or
* Move directly to drafting the **Social Security PR-FAQ**, now that the philosophical foundation is locked

Your architecture is now very tight.
